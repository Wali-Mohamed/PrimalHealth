Yes it&apos;s  true, but Aajonus didn&apos;t mention other fat for some reason. I think you can add 1 or more tablespoons of dairy cream with the given quantity of coconut cream as usual.

A: To remove one molecule of mercury, it takes about 50-200 fat cells. The mercury molecule is not as small as salt but is still a very, very tiny molecule. And in each vaccine back in those days had 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury. Multiply that 50-200 times and you can eat and digest about ten million molecules in a day. So you’ve got a lifetime of getting rid of mercury in vaccines depending on the number of shots you got. But you not only have to deal with mercury in those vaccines – you have liquid aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, and detergent. That’s another 500-600 times the toxic molecules of mercury.

Aajonus: I had this one fellow. The only problem, real problems that I have are with patients who have been skinny a long time in their lives. And I mean bird legs and bird thin all their life. They didn’t have any fat to store poisons. They went into the cells. So all their cells are terribly contaminated. Those are my worst patients. They are always in pain, they are always suffering, they are always in fatigue. When they reach that straw in their life it breaks their back of health. It sometimes takes 10 years, eleven years before they are at a normal plane. So it is difficult.<br><br>Now I had one fellow that came to me two years ago that was in that shape. He was calling me all the time. Those people do. I only have four of them right now. Two of them now are pretty well. Two of them call me pretty regularly. One has been on for three years and one two years. He came to see me in Chicago. He was grey, he was grey, I mean grey, not any pink in his skin. Nothing, he was grey. He was dark grey around here almost charcoal, like a raccoon.<br><br>Audience: What causes that?<br><br>Aajonus: That is metal poisoning, especially tin and mercury from injections and aluminum.<br><br>It is a good thing because they are trying to throw it out, and they throw it into the skin. 90 percent of the toxins are supposed to leave thorough the skin. In those people they have so many toxins it is going to go layer after layer after layer because it is deep in their tissue. There are a lot of people that I have seen where the toxins are not in the cells. They are out in the serums and outside the cell tattooed on the cell wall (not clear), so there is not as much functionality. But there is less pain and suffering in those people.<br><br>So this fellow came in the door and it was only 2 years and he was pink. So he was still a little grey here but he didn’t look like a raccoon any more. He was still smiling and happy, and this guy didn’t smile any time that I had seen him in the last two years or over the phone with him, nothing happy about him. But all of a sudden about 4 months he stopped calling me. I saw him 7 months ago when I was in Chicago. And I saw him last weekend, last week.<br><br>So I said O.K., you are not from this planet, right? Because in his intestinal tract, if you look at an iris, you’ve got the outer edge, you have got the pupil and around the pupil you are going to find this (not clear) that is the intestinal tract. His intestinal track was completely black. You could not tell (not clear) his intestinal tract; dark black spokes coming out from that in his pupil. That’s how much mercury and heavy metals he had in his intestines.<br><br>He was one of those skinny, skinny individuals that absorbed all those poisons and couldn’t throw them off because he had no fat to throw them off. So here he walked up, I photographed his eyes. I can see his entire digestive tract. 90 percent of the metal is gone. And he looks it. And I said What planet are you from? This isn’t natural or normal. He said I’m am doing better. I’m feeling good and he said I don’t see the difference but I feel the difference, I feel happy now, I feel energy. He went from bone thin like Jim was and a lot of other people, several other people who are here, bone thin, thinner than he. So he was big, his waist... he probably went from a..., he is about 6 feet 2 inches. He probably went from a 31 waist to 42. But he was strong, he had red skin, not all grey except around the eyes. It was just like a miracle. I’ve seen that a few times. But the people were not honest with me.<br><br>I said O.K., I want you to tell me what you eat. Take me through a day. He said I am going to be honest. I have been eating maybe 10 times more [raw unsalted] cheese than you told me. I said I gave you a minimum. I don’t care if you eat 10 pounds a day. I just want you to eat a minimum of a little cube of cheese, of a half a teaspoon every 15 minutes. He wouldn’t stop eating it, he just kept eating and eating and eating it and going through a pound, a pound and a half a day.

I tell people, that’s what vacuums. It absorbs the poisons out of the stomach and intestines and in 7 months he did that. You have to understand when I give you something, it is a minimum not a maximum, it’s a minimum. So pig out on the cheese if you have intestinal poisoning and you want to get rid of metal poisoning faster. Get fat for a while on cheese. Cheese will make you fat. You don’t digest it - the raw cheese - you won’t digest but it will allow you to utilize all your other foods to completely build and detox and heal, while the cheese goes through and does the main detoxification. So you are able to use all those foods that I tell you to eat. And I tell everybody to eat a lot with a lot of butter. So if you want to move fast through your poisons, do it. Lots of cheese.<br><br>Audience: One pound of cheese a day?<br><br>Aajonus: He is 6 feet 2 inches tall. You may want to eat 1/2 a pound of cheese a day.<br><br>Audience: With butter?<br><br>Aajonus: I had him first thing in the morning, I had him eat a little butter and several times a day, like once an hour he had a little bit of butter with so much cheese just so you don’t get too dry from it.

Yes daily juices too... There is a few very effective things in addition to cheese such as oysters daily, and moldy berries after some time on the diet where Aajonus gives almost as impressive stories.

&quot;Then about every -- this depends upon you and what you&apos;re willing to do - cheese going through like a train picking up the poisons up all day long. Because when I look into the irises, that intestinal belt all around the pupil is everyone&apos;s darkest area. That&apos;s because of the mercury and all those poisons have tattooed into the intestinal lining and everybody&apos;s throwing off mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum constantly into their food.  Well if you have cheese going through there every few minutes, every 15 minutes, every 20 minutes --  15 minutes would be 4 x’s an hour you have a little cube,  every 20 minutes would be 3 x’s an hour a little cube, every 30 minutes would be 2 cubes an hour.  45 minutes would be two cubes every 2 hours -- so you pick how you want to do it every half hour would be two cubes. So you pick how you want to do it.<br><br>I do it - when I&apos;m not lecturing - every 20 minutes. The people who have done that - I have construction workers who are full of heavy metal poisoning and radioactive material and all kinds of asbestos and stuff.  They&apos;ll have it every 15 minutes and how they make it work - they prepare.<br><br>This is how you make this diet work. You prepare all the foods for the entire day in your first hour of the day.&quot;

It&apos;s more of a principle for me now. I&apos;ve been to 15 different doctors with several 100 appointments and had my blood drawn probably 20 times, if not more. Non of them helped me in the way pd have done so far. Not even close. So why go to someone who believes in the exact opposite of health to take tests that also has nothing to do with health? It doesn&apos;t make sense to me.

Also i think it&apos;s an important transition to stop relying on someone else for YOUR health. It&apos;s just a modern concept to &quot;go to the doctor&quot; if you need help with health. Ppl say it like they are in a trans. Thats just what you do. I think it&apos;s important to start figuring out stuff on your own. You will learn more and also get more of your health in your own hands. Aajonus experimented alot. That&apos;s why he got so far, we should do it too and not be like helpless baby birds waiting for someone to save us all the time.

When I drank raw milk for the first time I had a massive headache that started in my forehead two days later, right in under my eyes. Then it progressed to the side of the head, then it was a headache, neck soreness, body aches and light fever. <br><br>Now 14 days later the fever is gone since a week ago along with the body ache, the headache is less and most of the pain has moved down to the neck and further to the trapetzius area with same soreness. Some days better some days a little worse still. So something definitely got moving from the head down to the neck/upper back.

&quot;It&apos;s one of the Bushs and his pharmaceutical grade people who are out to<br>destroy all of us. So they&apos;re pushing hard for it. In the last 2 years I&apos;ve been<br>researching a lot on the effects of vaccines and I was looking at some children<br>before they were vaccinated and then after they had been vaccinated with<br>penicillin. Penicillin looks like it&apos;s one of the worst diseases there is, the<br>disease of having a penicillin injection. Because that penicillin is a mold that<br>grows on grains. It&apos;s familiar in the poultry industry and it doesn&apos;t cause<br>havoc in the poultry system because that mold is a part of them. But in the<br>human system, which is built for things like gangrene, it is normal for humans<br>or even an animal; that kind of mold is indigenous for a human and is very<br>helpful as long as you don&apos;t get too poisoned by chemicals. Chemicals all cause<br>all diseases, they&apos;re not caused by bacteria or parasites or any microbes, it&apos;s<br>always pollution, poisons, industrial poisons that cause all diseases. When<br>these children had been given penicillin within about nine months it shows up<br>yellow all throughout the intestinal tract and the nervous system, all around<br>where they get the injections. It&apos;s the first primal weakness, the whole<br>shoulder and neck connection. And I always wondered what caused it. I knew it<br>was a lot of injections. I thought it was mainly all vaccines but they give<br>penicillin usually at a very young age to children. I found it caused almost 90%<br>of the Crohn&apos;s disease and IBS... caused by penicillin. They say that they<br>sterilized the molds, but molds you can&apos;t keep down, molds come back from the<br>dead just like the Phoenix. They can become active as early as 9 months and as<br>late as 18 months.&quot;<br> <a href="https://aajonus.online/qna/2006_12_17#:~:text=It%27s%20one%20of,as%2018%20months">https://aajonus.online/qna/2006_12_17#:~:text=It%27s%20one%20of,as%2018%20months</a>.

2008 04 26 CH workshop  05:16:00 &quot; Penicillin is grown on grain mold. Penicillin is grain mold. They sterilize it, it destroys the RNI and DNI which tells the fungus to go to into hibernation, so when you are injected or given penicillin, that fungus will live in you body forever, unless you know how to get rid of it, and i have not seen one person eyes in 30 years, that did not have a sign of penicillin growing profusely in their bodies. I have seen some people with a smaller amount then others, and some people with the massive amount. And the people who had the largest amount where the people who had fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. They usually have heavy metals all over the body or having raging penicillin growing everywhere, true out the tissue, if you have yellow colour in your eye you are full of it, if you are supposed to be blue but are green your eyes are full of penicillin. People with brown eyes are loaded with it too. Brown eyes should be amber, not dark brown or black.&quot;

To birds no, cuz it&apos;s a mold specifically for birds but to human, probably not and especially when some noob human have put their greasy little hands on it by sterilizing it and thereby making it go bananas in your body. It has no breaks after that and will continue to eat on you and get more aggressive if you feed it grains, which it&apos;s suppose to eat since birds eat grains mainly.

The naturally sparkling effect has some benefits in dealing with toxins, similar to hydrogen peroxide. I don&apos;t think aajonus said that plain mineral water is bad, he just talked how we should not be drinking much water in the first place and get our hydration from food and milk and veg juices. He did mention how he recommends naturally sparkling mineral water, or mineral water because its the least polluted water, not that we should be drinking a lot of in the first place.

&quot;I continue to advise that if drinking water, the safest (chemical-free) water is naturally sparkling mineral water in glass. However, the very best water if we are going to drink water would be algae-rich lake water with all of the bacteria and other organism in it. I have heard the tales of malaria in stream and lake waters throughout tropical environments and I believe it is myth just as 99% of all medical information is myth, which is designed to keep us taking medication rather than heal.&quot;

I mostly drink eggs or raw milk, but do drink water and coffee to a small extent. I have my own well and a gravity flow cold spring and live far out into the wilderness in Sweden, so my water is as safe as it gets from birth control pills, psycho meds, chemicals and so on.

NEED HELP 🙏 I am on vacation with a friend of mine who tested positive for the covid test 4 days ago.  Fever, then loss of taste and smell and sinusitis, and muscle weakness.  is healing with the remedies of aajonus: formula with eggs lime lemon honey royal jelly pollen and propolis, aloe vera and coconut oil.  I also took this formula and it seemed that I was fine but today I put my feet in the icy water of a stream and now I have a high fever and severe pain all over my body and head!  i think i got covid from him because we slept in the same bed.  I don&apos;t understand what I&apos;m detoxifying because I was fine and I&apos;ve been eating raw for a long time ..

First, just don&apos;t panic, everything will be alright. You could do pneumonia formula, i heard it helped some people when they had some symptoms related to their lungs. And then for pain, do lubrication formulas, milkshakes and just rest and you will be fine

Eating a lot of meat is important but you can eat less meat and utilize it 10 times more (literally). This is why pâtéeing and royal jelly, and slightly fermenting, and all the other ways, turn a single little piece of meat into huge bio-available matter in your body.

For temporary weight loss more lean meat, yes. Eat that all day long and you should drop weight fast. (I did that experiment with the raw chicken breast only diet for 2 weeks). But do it only a few days max, then you have &quot;protein starvation&quot;, and fat deficiency is the biggest problem we have even when we try to eat enough fat.

Yes mixing is ok. I just you know poured the sauce on top of the chicken pâté, mixed it with a spatula until it absorbed everywhere, and left it in a bowl with a plate as a lid overnight.

My first attempt at Deli Pâté is in the fridge marinating. I blended chicken meat into a paste (still a bit coarse cause I don’t have a food processor), and made a sauce with lemon juice, olive oil, shallots, garlic, parsley, a little ACV and a touch of honey. For the sauce I blended all the ingredients except the olive oil, which I added after blending the rest so it wouldn’t turn into mayonnaise. Then I put the meat in a glass container, poured the sauce over it a mixed it in with a spoon. I’ll try it tomorrow and see how it turned out.

Swedish sami don&apos;t exist genetically. It is a finno-scandic population (kvens) that adopted a culture from siberian herders but those siberian herders were like eight people 6000 years ago or something. Samis are not like indians or something. We are indistinguishable genetically from swedes or finns of northern sweden/finland. Basically. Sami in Finland obviously being less scandinavian.

It is a very distinct culture, though. No mistake. The genetic thing is a fact, though. Even most swedes and sami do not know this, and it is a touchy subject.

What do you mean? Asian? Such a thing never existed. Kvens were finno-scandinavians, basically. They adopted a siberian culture and became sami long ago. But do not come from siberia.

Btw, I tried to eat fruit yesterday for the first time in 7 months. Haven&apos;t eaten any carb either since then and I can tell you, it was &quot;meh&quot; at most. <br><br>I had 1 unripe banana and 1 ripe banana. I ate the unripe no problem, kind of nice but then i tried the ripe, just a small bite but spit it out immediately, too sweet!

I don&apos;t count. What I do best is eat fat until I am full, then start again later on (like 2h).<br>Doing it = I feel great, Not doing it = I feel bad, it&apos;s as simple as that.

I heard about a guy who conditionally accepted the military vaccines so they couldn&apos;t discharge him for denying it because he didn&apos;t. But the condition was that he have life insurance of up to 3 million to cover him and health insurance for any adverse reactions. If they deny that they are kind of admitting that the vaccines are dangerous and can be sued. I think it&apos;s a good strategy. I&apos;m doing the same for my mother who is a nurse and so far so good. She hasn&apos;t heard back from them

Yes, you need a lot more fat if you eat chicken breast for example, which is very lean, and the protein inside will use a lot of fat coming from elsewhere.

First blend because then the sauce gets everywhere inside.<br>Otherwise &quot;only&quot; the surface marinates and the inside is still the same as the start.

Recipe is &quot;Chorizo&quot; recipe. Tomatoes, bell peppers, spicy peppers, lemon, vinegar, honey, garlic, onion (avoid too much onion you can lose parasites from them), optionally mushrooms, in cream.

You can make a big batch of that sauce (like 2L), then it will ferment in the fridge into a CHORIZO smell and taste! Then you can pour it on your fresh pâté for even faster marination.

It&apos;s good to eat the pâté with some fat, and then wait 15 min and eat all the rest of the fat. That is more optimized for digestion.
