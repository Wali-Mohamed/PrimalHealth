My humble thoughts on cardiovascular problems is that we miss out on and overlook vitamin K2 in a modern diet.K2 is important for the transportation of calcium in the body and has shown to help both relieve cardiovascular complications and at the same time strengthen the bones.K1 is a different, more common form that is utilized in the body for coagulation.Though I have read some studies on K2 I am still not so knowledgeable on the best food sources or if there are any good supplements. The food source I know and use is cod liver oil since it has other fat soluble vitamins like D3 that work in synergy with K2"

2019-06-19,09:17,Andrej,I think it's not about the naturally occurring enzymes in food because that theory might be false in my opinion. So it makes sense what is written there in the article. I believe it's more about the fact that the raw food gets better recognised by the body and therefore the body can better produce its own enzymes to break down the food and assimilate the nutrients.

2019-08-06,01:05,Deleted Account,"The most important reasons are to me that heating your food above 115 degrees F (45 Celsius):*Kills enzymes. Enzymes help you digest your food. Your body can create enzymes but that process takes a lot of energy. This process makes you feel tired and heavy after a cooked food meal. Further, the enzymes your body makes are not as efficient and effective as the ones that were destroyed in your food.Consequently, your food is not be broken down as well and thus harder to digest. This also results in food starts rotting in your intestines, that parasites have more chance to surviveIt is further believed that your body has a limited amount of enzymes that it can produce. If the supply is finished, body organs will function less and less. It will accelerate aging.*Changes the pH of the food and makes food acidic. We like to eat alkaline foods. Eating acidifying food makes your body a welcome feeding ground for disease.* Converts easy to absorb minerals into inorganic - hard to absorb - minerals. INorganic minerals such as calcium are hard to absorb and might cause calcium stones, whereas organic ones are easier to digest, make you alkaline, help you get rid of too many acids* Destroys most vitamins* Destroys the life force. Eating cooked food is eating dead food. This will make you feel heavy and tired. Live food has live energy. It will give you energy. Simply put. A raw seed will grow, a cooked seed won't. When you pick (raw) unripe fruit it continues to ripen for weeks. Cooked fruit starts to decay within days.These reasons are enough to explain why most people on a raw food diet feel more energetic and have a stronger immune system."

2019-08-20,14:30,Antón Leitón,"Tom Barnett9 horasON PARASITES AND CANDIDA/MOULDI'll share what I've found with fungal and parasite infections from a lot of experience with myself and others.A lot of what I learned initially came from Paul Chek.  Don't think I've recommended him on here before but he's been the bulk of my formal education in health, body, mind etc.  Have a read of How to Eat Move and be Healthy for a start.I came to my own conclusions about fungus and parasites before i found AV's work which is why I resonated with his books.  I found them to be janitors as he describes rather than invaders but I've found there to be some context in that.Paul puts people on fungus and parasite protocols.  While I don't agree with that entirely (in context), his knowledge of how and why they have the effects they do in people is second to none.  He's treated people who have visible parasites crawling under the skin and in people's eyeballs which can render them blind, as well as helping evacuate a 12 inch sclerous worm from a woman's vagina.Anyway, I've found that fungus and parasites are there for 2 reasons:underlying chemical toxicity not due to lifestyleunderlying toxicity as by-product of lifestyle choices.The first is due to reasons outside of your control such as amalgam fillings, vaccines and other medical practices and general chemical exposure.The second is the residues caused by processed food diets, poor hormonal control, sleep wake cycles, unnatural living practices etc.In the first case the diet if followed 100% should take care of the deep toxicity by itself.  For chronic conditions I still recommend chelators using the Andy Cutler protocol if mercury and other heavy metals are a definitive cause.  Using anti infection agents is not recommended.For those who have a weakened body due to lifestyle (the reason you have fungus and parasites) there are different options available.  The diet itself should strengthen the body, leaving no purpose for infections.  This is why just nuking them with medicines only leads to reinfection if the body hasn't been strengthened.  You also need to make sure all the basics are in place such as regular tonifying movement, proper sleep wake, natural light exposure, pooing properly and regularly, having a dream and purpose in life and using those to keep the mind in check, as every infectious organism has an energetic equivalent, ie parasites correlate to parasitic behaviour as well as victim mentalities, mercury is attracted to emotions such as resentment etc.A bad lifestyle will outweigh a good diet in my experience, so the best diet in the world still won't keep infections at bay if you're disregarding nature's laws.If you have very debilitating symptoms, I usually suggest a short course of anti parasitic/fungal remedies in low doses while at the same time upping the foods that strengthen the body and relieve toxic byproducts or 'die off.'  Baths and saunas also help with this.  Keep in mind that heavy medicine such as oregano oil can kill off beneficial gut bacteria.Any protocol taken to reduce infection load needs to take into account the life cycle of the organism in question.  Parasites usually need a 10 day on, 5 day off cycle (or vice versa for different species) repeated 3 to 5 times to take care of eggs etc.  Fungus is similar but can act on monthly cycles.I usually don't recommend killing things unless you're in a really bad state.  Usually cleaning up the diet and lifestyle has the best effect, but if you're about to go blind or can't function/work and therefore eat etc I recommend low doses of oregano oil, black walnut, wormwood, golden seal etc in addition to foods such as papaya seeds, chilis, onion, garlic, ginger etc.Hope that helps."

Still experimenting. The first one i made i left it in a glass container kept reairing it and it started to melt and became really stinky. Probably it was too humid and the fungus made too many enzymes too fast.If the humidity is right there will always be fungi"

2020-07-19,16:36,Antón Leitón,"-2012 info])Organs are to be eaten especially when craved. Aajonus said he saw in a dream that the body analyzes the specific proteins which helps it relearn to make its own.He says that on this diet you need it less and less. For example you could need liver 3 days in a row, then once a week, then month, etc.A warning exist for testicles for instance. It assists in the body's function, but eating them more than 3 days in a row could lead to the body getting ""lazy"" on doing it itself (so it becomes detrimental).Blood is not mentioned much. It can be mixed with milk like the Maasai do and apparently tastes like melted ice cream.ANYTHING THAT FITS AFTER MEAL MEALS common recurrences:- pure fat exactly 15min after: perfect timing for the fat to be digested (proteins help digest fats, fats takes 3 times longer to digest, meat takes 20min to clear from stomach, so eating 15min later is perfect moment for it to be digested without catching up and slowing digestion)- moisturizing formula 15min after: same, best to get big very fast! (such as bodybuilding with visual results that made one of Aajonus' client's gymmates accuse him of taking steroids)- cheese+honey combo 35min after: best mineral supplement. Not 15min after like the 2 previous most likely because of the high mineral concentration, or it could be because it takes longer to digest than more regular fat.Those 2 can be had on their own (don't hesitate!) but they will be the most effective in this 2-course menu.and why not:- milkshake 35min afterwards (not too close to meat for aforementionned reason, meat/milk smoothies are not optimal)- papaya custardFats can be eaten with pretty much anything. They are more neutral in pH.Butter feeds most body, cream also feeds nervous system (30/90 more types of cholesterol made) but takes longer to digest (so eat a few tablespoons daily, and if you binge, only do so every other day), animal fat tissue performs all functions and digests the easiest (it is already processed into an animal tissue cell), avocado is second hardest fat to digest (so 1 per day max), can provide detox.Oils are mainly (90%) solvent-reactive and are useful for detox, but dehydrating. With meat they can remove old scar tissue of the type of meat eaten, but you also need meat with more soothing fat to rebuild afterwards.Coconut cream is very detoxifying even though the oil is only 7% of it. It has perfect proportions of solvents (5% carbs, 15% proteins, 80% fats), a max of 3 tablespoons per day (only 1 if fermented).Main vegetables used in juices and quick summary of their use:- celery: base of juice (the blood is very high like the ocean in sodium, celery meets that almost perfectly without causing the clumping of the sodium molecules that salt does)- parsley (20%): second main one ;alkalinity, Vitamin E and chlorophyll- carrot (30% max, more like 5-10%): can remove toxic bile especially from individuals who used to be skinny, which gives orange tint (not beta-carotene). According to Aajonus this is why some Asians have more yellow skin, the bile used to bind to rice.- cilantro (5% max): removes heavy metals (deep-rooted mercury)- beet (10% max): helps in production of Hydrochloric Acid (used for protein digestion)- cabbage (5-10%, GREEN OR WHITE only otherwise does opposite): prevents bleeding/hemorrhageSome fruits such as lemon and summer squash (for skin, collagen precursors and silica) are sometimes addedBerries, especially moldy, pull out heavy metals.Raspberry and blueberries will get the most out.Aluminum : raspberries  and strawberriesMercury, lead and other dark metal: dark berries (blueberries are very good and they take it out smoothly, blackberries give heavier detox, even some dementia)Iron: raspberriesArsenic: dark berries (such as blackberries, blueberries and boysenberries.""Rules to follow (by importance):- You need to eat a lot of fat overall and in ratio to protein.- Don't eat too alkalizing matter close to meat in particular. Usually separate by 1h before and after, except in morning meat can be had 4"

Even if they say organic, that the soy has been fed organic they have to process it and use a chemical treatment, because raw soy kills any bird, any poultry. Just like Raw soy will kill a human. So it has to be solvent and heat treated so it is a highly processed food. So i don't eat chickens that are fed a lot of soy nor eggs that are from chickens that are fed a lot of soy. If is over 30-25% soy i don't touch the eggs or the chicken."

So it's not and allergy to that milk normally. I only find 1 out of a 1000 who has truly the symptoms of allergy that continue even if they are having 2 to 4 ounces of milk a day for year and a half. They still don't handle the milk well, but that's only 1 out of a thousand people who are already diagnosed as lactose intolerant to pasteurized milk.Q: [What dairy can they handle?]?A: I give them lots of butter and cheese, they just don't have fresh milk."

2021-03-06,19:30,Rom,"@oscarinho also for hair gel if you use a food and it smells the ginger seems like it can take care of thatQ: Well relative to that, you said dry skin. What's the dry skin remedy if you can't use commercial lotions?A: Well you have to use coconut cream. It will leave you slightly sticky but you have to use coconut cream.Q: But it smells like hell after it just molds. It gets moldy too. So, do you have a combination like with lemon or lime juice or something?A: Well no, because it just dries it out, so you really can't put anything with it. The only thing you can do is maybe mix a little ginger in it. A lot of people can't stand the smell of ginger with molding coconut cream. I never met, I used to use it for a masseuse, to get a massage, and every time I take it to someone who isn't on the diet to massage me and they smell that stuff, they get really offended. You know it's like ""Ew"", they get out of there; they're washing their hands and getting it off. So when I take coconut cream, even if it's soured, it's not so bad. When you try to camouflage it, it makes it worse for some reason. So just leave in the stinky coconut cream.Q1: I'm laughing because I used to put ginger on everything.Q2: Yeah we use ginger on everything so it's great stuff.A: But you'd be surprised; there are people who are normal people out there can't stand the combination, we all like it, but they don't. They become very offended.Q1: Your skin care cream is the best thing I've ever had. The Primal Facial Cream recipe in your book it's got butter, cream, coconut cream, ginger, and honey. It's excellent.A: You want some of that. Next question."

But not the penicilin roqueforti mold, nor that it was from the store. But you are right. I am just making excuses for not making my own no salt added cheese.  🙏Would you say it is better to throw away the raw salted cheese I have, live without cheese for some months until i make my own. Or would you say that it is not too bad to eat some raw salted cheese until that time as long as i don't use it as an excuse to postpone making my own raw no salt added cheese?Also, if I sometimes eat a cooked meal, I will need a tiny bit of salt to digest that, no?I never have headaches.

I think those are the three best foods for detox and almost all problems are resolved the quickest and easiest by just consuming extremely large quantities of those foods frequently. If it’s topical maybe you wanna apply something to the skin? (Like butter or cream or marrow or blood?) maybe topically applying clay or drinking it with mineral water might help?

For about 15yrs i had stomach pain and diarrhea, because of bad habits: alcohol almost daily, cigarettes, eating shit foods, huge amounts of chocolate, pastry. Tried vegetarian, vegan, cooked meat, no dairy, all sorts of things with no help to dis ease. Sensitive to everything i eat. Appendix removed at13yrs old, nothing wrong with it though, as per usual... About 7months ago found out about pd, been doing my best and so far is best i've felt. No stomach pain, no diarrhea. Cant have green juices: violent diarrhea and very irritable mood. Ive tried it with first cheese, then egg, then chewing small pieces celery, parsley and carrot and swallow the liquid, a sip of milk after. That seems to be ok. Other than that, i try to follow the daily routines, two meat meals a day, not everyday lube formula. Butter mainly for fat, sometimes animal fat cuttings. Cheesetrain not tried consistently yet, baths available starting from next week. I know i am not doing everything totally right, it takes some time to absorb and integrate to daily life. Seafish also makes nausea, lakefish no problem. Red meat too much drying and makes me aggressive and irritable, unless eaten with fish. Fowl no problem."

From my understanding traumas we pick up in childhood can have severe physiological implications that we drag on for life, (even traumas that you dont necessarily remember) it can be something as simple as a few instances of being rejected as a child as well, it doesnt have to be something severe like being molested or seeing someone die. Trauma that a person still carries in their psyche can be the root cause of various mental disorders or problems. Can be the root cause of physical ailments as well, unresolved trauma can also be like an anchor for affliction of sorcery or possession but thats another topic"

It's on plaque binding to toxins thrown off from the brain, it's everywhere. So how can that too much?

That means your whole body will not be protected for about two hours. Holds for grapefruit, too. Eat the whole orange with some of the white pith and get all the bioflavonoids, oils, esters in that. The juice has very little of them so you don’t digest it properly. You could balance by having cheese before and cream before or with the juice unless you’ve had a lot of fat beforehand. Always eat a fat with your fruit."

Relaxing, stretching and expanding the space between tissues with heat, relieves pain. When applying heat, sometimes tendons, cartilage and ligaments take 5-15 minutes to relax and pain may temporarily increase until those tissues relax and expand. However, usually 85% of pain is relieved within 15 minutes of heat application.However, if pain does not reduce to bearable, it is okay to apply ice for 1 minute or less without causing blood clots. Then reapply hot-water bottle. Alternat- ing heat and ice may be effective as long as the application of ice is less than 1 minute."""

We should regularly brush and rinse abrasive compounds that adhere to our teeth as plaque. Often, it takes about 72 hours only for those compounds to harm our dental cells. Brushing our teeth thoroughly at least once ever 3 days prevents caustically acidic plaque that causes cavities. Where toothbrushes do not reach deep in our gum pockets, we should rinse with a dental water-pick, removing the minerals and toxic compounds from gum pockets where minerals begin to dry and adhere to our teeth, becoming plaque."""

2022-11-13,20:40,Aiden,"Q: Should I be concerned about blood work that shows a lot of clumping and fibrils?  A: You should be jumping for joy. Clumping and fibers collecting in the blood means that they are being ejected from the tissues. Like my clients that have cancer there PSA will shoot up. Yet it is not spreading. A lot of the toxicity dumps. I remember a woman who was one of my first clients in 1980 before I ate the poison mushroom. She owned a health food store in Georgia. And she had a severe liver problem and had a liver transplant. Liver cells showed up in her blood after being on the diet for 3 months and it was such a concentration that the doctor fought her to death because he said your body is rejecting the liver. I am finding massive amounts of liver tissue in your blood. We need to get you another liver or you are going to die. He panicked the hell out of her. I said no you are not. You do not have any signs of it. Looking in the eye there is no deterioration. All it is doing is getting rid of old dead liver cells that you have not had the nutrients to get rid of before. Do not panic. How do I know that? I said I do not. You either have to trust my thinking or go the other way. It is up to you. She trusted my thinking with phone calls everyday. I mean I had to talk with her 10-15 minutes a day to help her pass through that psychology. And after a few months she went back to the doctor and he said your liver cells are too high, too high. Your liver is deteriorating. But she said I have no ill symptoms. I feel good. I am digesting my food fine and I feel better than I have ever felt. So you have to be wrong. And after two years she proved he was wrong because the blood was fine and blood did not have any liver cells in it and she was normal. The Masai tribe lives on blood, meat and milk and they do not have any heart trouble at all. And they have terrible blood according to science data."

There is no such thing as a definable immune system. Pharma and medicine are all over the place about it, making stuff up as they go.The body does not need to defend itself in natural environments. The medical/pharma industries created the term immune system to brainwash people into thinking that our bodies have to always defend themselves from nature and themselves. The lymphatic system is the only major system designed to cleanse the body when natural or unnatural toxic substances interfere with functions. There are literally millions of natural chemicals that result from lymphatic activity which pharma/medicine call immune-system activity.https://aajonus.online/topics/pdn27_bacteria"

Often the changes are there but we don't see the as significant because we are seeking to see changes in areas we deem important yet the body works on it's priorities. Our bodies are very intelligent and may be working on some internal aspects we are not yet connected to.

They mixed it with milk otherwise it strips your system., Aajonus claimed that the Massai only bleed their animals because they are no longer as wealthy as they once were. And that they never did mix the milk with blood when they had an abundance of milk. He also said that blood should be consumed with fat if you do have it.So like when we have meat we need to have fats with it, same with blood, we need to have some sort of fat.So only when the milk was not readily available did they drink blood.

2023-02-04,06:19,Aiden,"Regarding other people in scrutiny- Chris (eatrawmeat) I’ve known since late 2020 interacting with him on tiktok, he was part of the reason I started the diet. I was surprised when he didn’t have the integrity/principle to say or do anything about the consistent hateful behavior of Euro and Joe. Their negative mindsets were naturally being adopted by the many young males in the group relatively new to the primal diet (some of them under 18). Chris enjoyed the respect and status in the group he created, but didn’t take due responsibility as a role model and owner of the group- out of fear he would lose respect and fellowship of the unstable and resentful people he sanctioned. I was even more surprised when he blatantly lied to Rom, then changed the story multiple times to avoid admission when questioned, clearly lying to everyone that saw. Rom banned Chris AFTER discovering proof that Chris had lied so deceptively.Regarding Joe- he has a pattern of making irresponsible accusations and slandering people because of his own petty resentment. He’s clearly very hurt by conflicts in the past (like all of these people) and I feel for that, but ignoring his destructive behavior is ultimately a disservice.I’ve been in Primal Sanctum for months and observed what goes on firsthand. I stopped reading it (besides when tagged) after I questioned Chris about his lie to find that he doubled down and no one else mentioned anything about the clear deception. Unsurprisingly- Joe aided Chris in his deflection to make him feel better about his lie (friends help each other out you know, especially with a common enemy…) and Euro reinforced it by reacting to messages, while everyone else was silent about it. Today in that group I brought up this topic again, and later the topic of death threats, discerning bias, etc, spending about two hours. Joe and Euro were not receptive, although Euro started to say it technically/legally wasn’t a threat and that he already said maybe he could have gone about it better. One other participated and stayed relatively neutral (which we should all appreciate). Others watched silently.To bring this full circle- have empathy for those acting out. At their core, they don’t mean bad at all. These things would be resolved quickly if we were able to magically see every experience of their life (most importantly childhood) and how it naturally resulted in defense mechanisms and constructs surrounding a child who just wants love. It’s not productive to resent people. But sometimes there’s not a gentle way to remedy people’s constructs which harm others and themselves. Showing them the faults in their constructs and defense mechanisms naturally brings out the wounded child feeling the trauma again. The main point of all this is to contribute to the community’s awareness of these things which affect all of us to some degree. This is just my interpretation of what I’ve seen, I do my best to know what I can’t assume and to account for my own bias, but it’s never absolute. I want to prevent hatefulness in this community, and for all.“Emotions were the gage of experience here, that is, what I and everybody felt and thought as a result of my actions was all important. The importance of these lives was creating joy/love. Unconditional love. Finally I glimpsed a lonely, unhappy, unloved and sometimes unloving life in this whirlpool. It was full of resentment. It was my “Dick” life. I relived that life. I felt sick, weak and angry. I realized that for my life to be happy I had to love myself completely.”As Aajonus would have wanted."

The rules for pets are no different to rules for humans in regards to nutritional needs. Our cat loves kidney and heart and especially liver. My other cat who has now passed on was experiencing terrible skin issues and hanging belly he was unhappy, I had to make a very drastic decision. I put him on just raw liver. At first he did not have much of it. I continued to feed him liver every day for nest 3 months. His coat began to really shine again, his belly got firm. He was a very happy and approachable kitty. Loved everyone. For the first week he struggled with the raw liver, it had to be organic btw. then I began to introduce him to other raw foods. The liver was to mop up the damage done from the kibbles."

And the article insists cows are eating the grass-loving microbes rather than their byproducts. But I didn't notice any mention of evidence that the microbes themselves are the cow's food source.

2023-08-22,12:05,RetardedFaggot,Little anecdote from me as well. Last year I was in the military. I remained unvaccinated against my orders. I filed for religious accommodation to not get the vaccine. I was required to take a PCR test everyday early in the morning due to being unvaccinated. Every time I got a false positive I had to quarantine in an old disgusting building full of sick people. I didn't get sick once for over a 2 month period despite being in close quarters with sick people with no masks. I wasn't even allowed to go outside at all for fresh air and I never got sick. That's my personal experience. I think germ theory is a load of shit man.

Eggs supply our intestines with rich proteins, fats, vitamins and other nutrients quickly and efficiently to cleanse and heal intestines as quickly as possible.Another method to increase digestive microbes is to eat high meat. See information about and methods to make high meat in my recipe book pages 148, and 174-177.❤️💖THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, FOUND IN HIS Q & AG: I have a friend and her 11 year-old-daughter was just diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. What is your opinion on why she has that? Is it diet? Or, stress and diet? She has never been hospitalized or anything as a child, nothing like that.A: Well, I would say from my experience of Crohn’s disease it could be many, many things.G: They did a colonoscopy where they saw lesions on her lower intestine, her upper intestine and by her stomach. They did the whole barium thing.A: Right. The only people who I have seen to have Crohn’s disease are people who have eaten a tremendous amounts of cooked starches – lots of cereal and lots of sugars. And it destroys the intestinal environment completely; there is usually no bacteria present.G: They are high pasta eating.A: Yeah. 🔥No bacteria present in the intestines, so everything rips the intestines and it bleeds and causes lesions and scaring.G: So, what should she be doing – the child?A: 🔥Lots of raw eggs; lots of smoothies; lots of meat – anything that will create the bacteria. She can even take the raw clabbered milk and do the infusions like I said in the intestines to build it up.YOU HAVE FEAR OF MEAT, NO NEED TO FEAR MEAT, IT'S VITAL FOR YOUA. Lots of eggs. Lots and lots of eggs. Lots of eggs. Lots of eggs. You have it with eggs and milk but you need eggs by themselves. And fresh aloe juice. I would down 10-12 a day if I were you. I would concentrate on that for about a 5 to 6 week period. Also eat some meat and milk. All of it raw. … Raw eggs will be the best and smoothies are wonderful. I am not going to ever advise anyone of their children of taking drugs but I would never do it. I would never allow my child to take prednisone and if I were the child I would never take it. It would go down the toilet or be buried in the back yard. It would never get in my body. And if I had to sneak down into my closet to drink down 4 eggs a day I would do it. And it would get rid of it pretty quickly. You never want to refrigerate it.Q. For some people you never suggest more than 2 eggs at a time?A. That all depends on the individual. For her, I would never suggest having more than 2 at a time."

I've been curious about the real reason for latent dental infections in a lot of people too, as many of us in the US that sadly had our wisdom teeth removed, show low bone density and hot spots at those sites even a decade later. My husband shows deterioration to the point of a hole in the bone. We found that out before we were on primal, but I guess primal helps us heal that?"

The only way I’ve come across of physically doing something like that to clean the blood is sungazing, the UV light having that effect as the entirety of the blood passes through veins in the eyes every 2 hours. Maybe it’s actually not good for plastics though. Maybe molds can deal with plastic, extremely slowly though, and probably not in the blood or stomach… it would be great to know a way to deal with it, maybe Aajonus would know.

Their leader lost his morale and they really followed like mindless puppets. It’s not just Erik, they join in and enable what he is doing and have literally reduced my worth as a human in their minds and think that I can be treated in any way they want. I defend myself finally for the first time and do to them what they’ve been doing to me for months and I’m a “bitch” and a “sociopath”.

How much does a cow cost in the US?I suppose prices may differ according to the breed.For example here in my country you can buy a dairy goat for 30$ and for 1500$ and even more Depends on the breed.Baby goats are the cheepest because in order to get milk an animal must bear babies. And there are cases when it can be infertile or bring dead babies etc That's why animals who already give milk are much more expensive. Also the older the animal the more milk it usually gives.

I was thinking yes we get imbalanced from overusing isolated red light like AV warns about (like eating isolated supplement nutrients or eating fractionated cooked foods) and getting full spectrum light from sunlight is like a full natural vitamin.However how much time have we exposed our eyes, faces, skin to isolated frequencies of blue light from TVs, laptops, phones. To me some isolated red light for short durations may be therapeutic in the short run"

2024-05-05,01:46,Rom,"Humble also states that MMS does not harm the body's good bacteria. He refers only to digestive bacteria. MMS will eventually permeate all tissues. Consuming MMS concentrates chlorine and sodium. It is an imbalance. If it were a balance, don't you think that the body would naturally contain such a solution? My assumption is that the body has been working wonderfully for millions of years because it knows how to balance itself when fed properly.It seems harmless to intestinal bacteria because intestinal bacteria normally live in a hydrochloric acid (high chlorine) environment. However, taking blood bacteria or most non-intestinal bacteria into such an environment would be like taking freshwater fish and putting them in salt water.Humble states that the non-biological sodium in it will dilute and be harmless. Any sodium that is NOT in a biological solution with other nutrients is destructive. Pure sodium is an explosive more volatile than nitroglycerin. Anyone who has a hard time conceiving that salt is an explosive, I suggest you watch this video where salt is sprinkled on DEAD frog legs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YZJt_Bw3eo.(How Stuff Works explained it as:""Because these are fresh frog legs, the cells inside them are all still intact. The biochemicalmachinery still functions. There is still a source of energy for the muscles in the form ofunused ATP molecules stored in the cells. All that the muscles need is something to activatethem and they can still contract and relax (until they run out of ATP or something else shutsdown the biochemical machinery.""After reading that ""scientific"" babble, consider that, in a video by the same fellows on a skinned frog leg prepared at the same time, they sprinkled 3 times more pepper on the leg as they did salt, yet there were only 2 twitches. The twitches were because there was a little salt in the pepper. With pure salt applied, they twitched for about 20 minutes, until the sodium was spent. Additionally, sprinkling calcium, potassium and phosphorus separately did not cause twitching, only the table salt.)It is possible for anyone to test the effects of MMS with 2 good electronic microscopes in a 98 degree F. high-humidity room. The person tested should not have consumed MMS for at least 45 days. Rub some MMS on a fingertip and prick that fingertip to extract 2 drops of blood. Spread the blood gently on a thin glass plate (slide). Prick a finger that did not come in contact with MMS and also spread the blood gently on a glass slide.Watch and compare what happens to the blood cells in both situations. In the non-MMS-exposed blood, there is no panic, just a slow acceptance of the death that ensues when blood is exposed to oxygen out of the blood stream. In the blood exposed to MMS, watch the white blood cells eat the MMS, trying to protect the red blood cells from contact with MMS. Time the blood cells’ decomposition. In an hour, compare the coloration of the dried blood masses. Repeat the experiment several times. However, only compare blood taken at the same time because body chemistry changes every 20-40 minutes.Appreciatively and healthfully,"
