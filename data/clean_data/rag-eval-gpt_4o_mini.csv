"The elimination of mercury from the body is a complex process that primarily involves the binding of mercury to fatty acids. According to the context provided, it takes approximately 50-200 molecules of fat to safely remove one molecule of mercury from the body. This process is relatively slow and can take a significant amount of time, with estimates suggesting that it could take up to 90 years to rid the body of mercury accumulated from vaccines if multiple doses have been received.

Mercury is theorized to be ""in suspension"" and ""stored away"" in the body, but it is important to note that once mercury is bound to fat, it becomes isolated and thus less capable of causing immediate damage. Additionally, certain foods like cheese may help speed up the detoxification process by aiding in the binding of mercury to fat.

Furthermore, the body utilizes several mechanisms for detoxification, but the solvent process—where the body metabolizes a composition of fats, proteins, and alcohol—plays a significant role in detoxifying harmful substances such as mercury. The lymphatic system also plays a critical role in collecting toxins and eliminating them through the intestines and other bodily systems.

In conclusion, while the body has processes in place to eliminate mercury, it requires sufficient amounts of fat, and the process can be lengthy, highlighting the importance of dietary choices in supporting mercury detoxification.",2920,Can you explain the process of mercury elimination from the body?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of the process of mercury elimination from the body, discussing the mechanisms involved, including the binding of mercury to fatty acids, the role of dietary choices, and the significance of the body's detoxification systems.
