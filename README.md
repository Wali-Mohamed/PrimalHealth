![Alt text](/images/Primal_Diet_App_Interface.jpeg)


### Problem Description

Primal Insight is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that helps individuals seeking guidance on the Primal Diet, a dietary approach focused on consuming raw, unprocessed foods. The problem this project addresses is the difficulty in extracting valuable and contextually accurate diet and health advice from large volumes of unstructured online conversations. Information shared within health-focused communities can be overwhelming, and users struggle to find specific, relevant insights in real time.

This project solves the problem by using machine learning models to analyze and retrieve diet-related insights from extensive Telegram group discussions about the Primal Diet. It provides users with precise and actionable responses based on community conversations, improving accessibility to advice on this niche diet.

### Data Description

The data comes from a Telegram group where members discuss various aspects of the Primal Diet, collected between February 14, 2019, and September 14, 2024. Each conversation is transformed into a structured dataset with fields for timestamp and content. An example of the dataset looks like this:

|    Date       |    Time  | Content                                                 |
|---------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|

### Topic Analysis

Using a Gensim LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model, we identified key topics discussed within the dataset. These topics reflect the core areas of interest in the Primal Diet community, which include:

1. **Water Usage**: Discussions about hydration and how people use water in their daily habits.

2. **Diet Preferences**: Focus on various diet approaches, including those advocated by figures like Aajonus Vonderplanitz.

3. **Primal Diet**: Conversations about the Primal diet and influencers like Sv3rige promoting raw food.

4. **Raw Dairy and Meat**: Emphasis on consuming raw milk, meat, and cheese for health benefits.

5. **Raw Food and Health**: Discussion on the impact of raw food, especially meat, on the body and overall health.


### Project Solution

Primal Insight processes these conversations, transforming them into an easily accessible and structured knowledge base. This enables users to retrieve relevant advice on diet and health directly from the community's discussions, making it easier to stay informed and follow the Primal Diet. By filtering out irrelevant content and providing targeted responses, Primal Insight offers a streamlined experience for users seeking guidance on raw and natural food consumption.
