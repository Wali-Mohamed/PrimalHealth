# Primal Insight

## Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a Language Learning Model (LLM) that leverages the latest conversations from the "Primal Diet" Telegram group over the last three months. The model is designed to provide tailored advice and insights related to the Primal Diet, enhancing adherence and understanding for both new and existing followers of this dietary regimen.

Primal Diet-focused datasets are essential for several reasons, particularly in the context of promoting nutritional health, advancing AI applications in dietetics, and supporting individuals committed to this lifestyle. Hereâ€™s why they are crucial:

## Training AI Models for Nutritional Guidance

The datasets derived from real-world interactions within the Primal Diet community are used to train machine learning and natural language processing models. These models are crucial in developing AI systems capable of offering personalized dietary advice, suggesting meal plans, and answering complex nutritional inquiries.
Supporting Personalized Diet Planning

In a landscape where dietary needs vary widely, AI-driven systems trained on diverse real-world data can provide individualized recommendations, helping users tailor their diet to their specific health conditions and goals.
Enhancing Community Engagement and Dietary Adherence

By providing accurate, accessible, and engaging information about the Primal Diet, these AI tools enhance community engagement. They foster a supportive environment that encourages persistence and adherence, crucial for long-term dietary success.
Reducing Barriers to Information Access

AI systems capable of interpreting and answering diet-related questions reduce the barrier to accessing nutritional information, making it easier for individuals to make informed decisions about their health.
Project Overview
The Primal Diet Advisor is a robust AI application designed to navigate the complexities of the Primal Diet using data from dedicated Telegram group discussions. This model can accurately answer a variety of queries, thereby educating users and aiding in diet adherence.

## The main use cases include:

- Providing guidance on daily meal planning specific to the Primal Diet.
- Offering personalized dietary recommendations based on individual preferences and historical data.
- Explaining the benefits and scientific backing of various aspects of the Primal Diet.
- Addressing common challenges and questions faced by followers of the Primal Diet.
- This project is implemented as part of an initiative to integrate advanced AI capabilities within the dietary and health domains.

### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the latest conversations held on the "Primal Diet" Telegram group, focusing on discussions from the last three months:

- Source of Conversations: Telegram group dedicated to the Primal Diet.
- Content Covered: Daily dietary practices, meal suggestions, personal experiences, and scientific discussions related to the Primal Diet.
- Language: English.
- Technologies
- Python 3.12 for backend and model training.
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and deployment.
- Elasticsearch for full-text search capabilities.
- Flask as the API interface to interact with the AI model.
- Grafana for monitoring system performance and PostgreSQL for database management.
- OpenAI's GPT model as the foundation for the language model, fine-tuned on the Primal Diet dataset.
## Conclusion
The Primal Diet Advisor is set to transform how individuals interact with and adhere to the Primal Diet. By harnessing cutting-edge AI and machine learning technologies, this tool not only facilitates better health outcomes but also fosters a knowledgeable and engaged dietary community.
