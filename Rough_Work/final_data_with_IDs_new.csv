Guess it depends how long they’ve been vegan for.. the diaz brothers for example there are a bunch been thinking about that i just like to play devils advocate, cos as i said i believe some ppl might do better on vegan diet than carnivore diet performing at highest level how does one that considers a vegan diet unhealthy/toxic explain highlevel athletes that kill it while on a vegan diet(outperform everyone else that does eat alot of meat etc) Sometines they are helpful yes Generally though they’re useless at best I agree I drive to get my milk Haha yea you hate em until you need one 😅 u ll be eternally grateful they exist They just don't understand nutrition that well or at all..

I enjoy reading them and picking them apart.. But for me it’s more of a common sense thing than anything Also domestication and breeding of fruits and vegetables, gives people an unrealistic sense of what veganism would look like in the wild People are also nomadic, you can’t just move to a new place and start eating all the plants you don’t recognize It’s really just common sense to me.. Go out deep in the wild and tell me how much you can sustain yourself on nothing but plants.",12,453

There is no one fits all What do you think about all raw animal products?. Fish, eggs, ruminants, organs etc The one mistake i thought all diets i tried had in common was that imho, people start to get tunnelvision, similar to a religion where in their mind their believes are the truth and everyone else is wrong.. Clearly carnivore diet works wonders for a lot of ppl no doubt, but the probability that its not optimal for a certain % of humanity seems extremely high time will tell like everyone else in the scene Also PEDs and genetics yes full of roids defoe vegan hamilton vegan Thing is, the carnivore group on here is actually very into high quality, organs, etc.. There’s other groups where people eat basically nothing but fully cooked, grain-fed hormone antibiotic meat Thanks!",6,165

I ate tons of greens.. Like huge ammounts of kale amd spinach, raw.... I think I got kidney stones.. Last summer I decided to do the elimination diet.. Only meat,cooked tho.. I felt so fucking great again!. Huge performance boost.. Then I started watching Sv3rige and added things like raw liver.. ""liver is an instant mood boost""..

I don't want to loose weigh when i googled tingling sensation of arms/legs also came up as side effect of histamine intolerance/overload :D sure lol for things where the science is extremely strong/onesided i prefer following science i guess Science does not talk about:raw meatRaw eggsFermented meatRaw milk I am just feelimg amazing with that your level of arrogance is the only thing that is insane right it doesnt, thats why i experiment myself you basically remind me of one of those hardcore vegans that looks down on anyone that doesnt agree with you those ppl exist in every ""dietcult"" so its nothing new i guess, though at a certain point someone has to say sth no insult, just trying to open your eyes ego is a hell of a drug the fact that you talking about winning kinda says it all lol I dont understand why you argue You spend a lot of time trying to help other people By Telegram is difficult to understand some explanations.Lets have a beer one day and talk about ""science"" Or a little piece of cheese its okie, just needed to get it off my chest little is good until i experimented more on what exactly the deal is with me and cheese 😁 okie not saying should avoid, just testing if maybe need to build tolerance and start lower amounts things like that cos i cant afford the tinging legs/arms in my life cos it costs me sleep and affect my work next day It was only a joke.I dont drink beerOnly a little wine in celebrations Imo its a short term solution.. taking vitamine C and tumeric is supposed to help/lower histamine levels if u have that issue i feel decent on vit c tons of studies strongly disagree with you everything checked out perfectly when i followed this trail histamine isnt very well understood but i ll try it out if i have the tingling next time and i take vit C + tumeric and it goes away i ll know with certainty then i know i need to take it easy on cheese and can experiment with what works for me and what doesnt but yea im just glad i likely found the cause cos its a terrible feeling when trying to sleep i ll lower my cheese consumption or go for the cheese that isnt skyrocking high in histamine milk seems fine but aged cheese seems to trigger it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I was thinking the same.. But you can try it by yourself Vit C is a shit",4,434
278,vit c is shit?. or the shit not sure what u mean is that how u argue lmao hahhahaha everything u dont understand is bs No....you get cleaned Artificial vitamine c is shit.. 💩Just my opinión...🙈 I felt horrible the last time that I try it..

They eat their physiologic food.. They should be able to metobolize the vaccines and handle with the poisons in a better way than we do.They are im contact with nature.. I am in pc or driving on my car all day long.. 200 phone calls a day.. A lot of vaccines, not only the child obligatory ones.. A lot of medicines.... Me too Getting hard to eat😢",9,100

Maybe they will go away with time I love Aajonus' voice!. It's calming Great to hear it again.Pity that cheese is salted.I may have to add butter,5,98

304,What do you mean?. I wouldn't buy.. Tunas in oil make me feel sick I dont mind the detox symptons if they dont affect much my lifeI think is part of the cleaning of our body Better in jar @ubeats1 They don't have that label We kill everything good with the heat and promote the growing of bad things Yes but i have tobe careful not to use warm water On the inner bends of my elbows and my neck.. Looked like I had been strangled :D,4,87

I see I am now eating the last piece of 9 weeks old high liver 😲😲 I was doubting about telling you to use your own Urine, when I have read Aajonus again I was telling him to aply it on his neck..

That's completely natural in the north atleast, but only once a year Fat for the winter, and during the winter you lose some or more Well I don't think anyone here does it anymore..

323,"What do you expect from cheese fermentation/drying as long as this is already fermented milk?. Stronger bacterial habitat?. As becoming more potent probiotic?. On cooked I feel:1.. Less satiated - more food needed2.. More thirsty - I drink more water3.. More irritated and stressed (or maybe it ovelaps with stress changing city in last days) You probably right.. May be I should just leave small piece of cheese in fridge and  observe the process I'm going to ask mine for same Anyway I already found local market, but it is so distant from me.In my hometown I had a lot more street markets with local products.. It were easier to go on raw there.New city is bigger, more crowded, richer buuuuut so deprived of Highquality food.Indeed it has store with so-called ""products from farmers"" buuuuut this is only the labels and stuff there is so overpriced What would be the better way to age it?. I tried outside the fridge for 2 weeks, bit it got too strong taste and almost liquid It could be fungi or bacteria Longer digestions",10,180
324,"In dark place?. I have bought the last without salt.. The woman that gives me the cream, made 1 for me Difficult to predict, I haven't done it yet I suggest results would vary depending on what type of microbiome would dominate piece of cheese I bet y'all already know that",3,51
325,No?. Ofc🙈,2,2
326,Aajonus says the sponge is hard cheese?,1,7
327,"Yes.can you age it without salt?. I like it.I want the receipt😄 Salt is not needed in cheese production It has almost zero salt and I also asked farmer if she could do it without salt.. So she replied that adding salt only because of taste demand of customers Best cheese I ever tried Great The man that sells me the cheese told me that it has to age under 9°C I go to the toilet now everyday.When vegan, i have been months without going by myself This week I stopped eating raw because moved for work in another City.. This means loss of all my connections with Highquality sources of food.. I ate cooked meat last few days and fermented veggies.. I definitely feel the difference now That looks good",6,131

329,"Is It unheated cottage cheese?. Ok.. I think that they help you im different waysBoth are important, imo Me, too Need lots of milk to make it snd i like it cold that's why i ferment it... You can easily make your own butter or just consume raw milk I would say pasteurized butter is much better than nothing Our raw butter goats are ybein vaccibated I guess it has been done with death milk You use 11 l !. 😂😂😂 For me it does not worth it 11 litres for 1kg of cheese.. The woman that sold me Better in the fridge We can try Yes do!. Yes.It isnt for the milk.. It is your liver cleaning your body Fiber only helps you go to the bathroom when you’re already clogged up with fiber 😅 it’s a cycle 😡 But for example when bulking with berries for the winter in my opinion isn't damgerous because of the fiber 😢 Becausr of thr acid Like sandpaper Maybe, in large doses and frequently It is bad firy the walls of the the gut All my beliefs ruined Even more than the juice 😒 I used to think it was necessary Useless, good Lok It aint poison it's just useless Fiber i mean",8,211
330,Because is poison?. My mum There are people That need it to poo Abd when we go to toilet thanks to it we are damaging ourselves,2,26

But the doctor says it helps to go to toilet🤷‍♀ 😭 Going to the butcher now to get ground beef not top quality but that's what i got.... 💪😁😁 I have started to do push ups against a chair to strengthen my stomsch  muscles and arms Ha ha....i don't miss them so much really.. no cheese, white fish gravalax.. and some cornichons from finland and sea trout roe and crayfisb Thanks for the advice.. I was thinking of it I feel like a new person right now.Half a glass of urine a little nap and I am new Mine didn't turn yellow.. It stayed ehite atleast the week I fermented it",7,118

And after running, eat raw anchovy and now I have naussea, I am tired and bloated I feel horrible today I know.... Sad the corruption Sally Morell acted quick and ereased them from the official site.... Something ain't right there Oh, 2 of the members on the board of directors died of cancer just in the beginning of the year.. They were on the WAPF diet protocol.. Sally Fallon Morell seems a bit fishy Bon appetit",7,127
345,Great look.What is there?,1,4
346,"Kind of?. No, SF area i think temp matters a lot.. once i got amazing yoghurt overnight in a hot country.. the milk was very fresh and hadn't been chilled.. maybe freshness matters too From the board of directors for example Me too Whats up y'all I guess at least it’s easy to find beef fat and raw dairy here 🤷‍♂️ California Russian Ой, не начинай:) Привет Украине I don't think i can improve that Dobry dyen!. Follow the grannies to get a good food.. It works in every country, i guess + I will film it New meme I check if we have local grannies 👌 😂😂😂 Sport drink:Cucumber, watermelon, whey, milk, tomatoe All the meat at the farmers markets is frozen too It’s frustrating as hell.. Really difficult to find high quality, and expensive as all hell",8,139
347,"What kind are the cows are they?. I buy it when they are milking and when i get home is still a bit warm but my cows are holstein and i don't get much cream.The cold tank they have reaches 4 degrees....too low That was my thought, or possibly Tchrets had sat around at room temp for some time before he bought it yea",2,64
348,Is it better to buy it warm?. maybe freshness and the lowest temp it's reached while refrigerated.. if it's been close to 0 maybe bacteria have died ah I can understand why on and off Sorry Frank is cool,3,39
349,From what?,1,2
350,What does it mean?. Very apparent No that dude is mental,2,11
351,With sv3rige?. Nah it’s just his attitude Silvia My English is bad today😒 That’s nothing in the grand scheme Should look towards people that have been doing it for more than 1-2 years,2,33

355,Sothbridge market?. 😂😂😂😂 Abd found out that the cheese i bought first had 1gr of sugar Not even in internet I cant find it 😭😭😭,2,25
356,But was unsalted?,1,3
357,"Ok?. Try today without meditation I mean, I understand the argument that the fermentation in their stomachs creates methane and all that.. But it doesn’t seem logical/instinctive to me that it’s actually got a significant impact on the atmosphere.. Seems fucking retarded, but I’ve never fully looked into it I don’t understand how animals doing natural things can contribute that much to GHG Unfortunately not.But sounds good I hate to play armchair psychologist but here I am lol",4,78
358,Is sverige health now going down?. Just saw a few videos analising what youtube vegan eat Anyone who speaks against fermented fish oil will be kicked from it,2,28
359,"Send?. WAPF is a corrupt corporation I can send you, if you want Oh yea one last comment, I absolutely can’t stand how Frank gives no credit to any kind of bacteria.. He claims the “high” people get from from high meat is all due to high K2 content.. It’s like he goes out of his way to ignore anything associated with AV Just discovered He doesn't like salt He died in a car accident, but claimed to be extremely healthy into his 70’s.. Although he seemed like the type to embellish a bit haha.It just reminded me of him when thinking about long-term, 20+ year people.. Because he’s the longest-term carnivore guy that I’m aware of He manufactured tons and tons of LSD in his day Yea lol Interesting guy at the very least He was a bit out there, lots of drugs.. And he wasn’t right about everything, but he was definitely a trail blazer Owsley Stanley.. He ate carnivore for like 55 years, he kinda paved the way for almost everyone that eats that way now",8,179
360,"I take it you’ve never heard about/read The Bear?. Yea at the very least, he’s an interesting one haha Diet-wise, you aren’t going to get anything new really, since you have read AV Lol thanks Funny comments That’s almost uniform amongst long term carnivore/raw paleo people.. No salt, or very very little (once a month or so) I really don't miss salt🤷‍♀ I get only  the one in cheese Thanks to Sv3rige I'm eating this way.. Hes putting out good info His laugh is funny",4,85
361,"Really?. He talks normal I will check I’ve always just watched for the entertainment, never for information.. But I find myself watching them less frequently lately anyway",3,27
362,Which are good for info?. But hes hella autistic too I cuted it and soaked in water to withdraw urine.. Buuuuut stones...,3,22
363,"Make a trip while on holidays?. I get it on Saturdays Bought beef kidney, found a lot of stones in them And also feel dust on my teeth😡 Impossible to eat😔",2,31
364,Is this common or just my bad luck?. 😘😘😘 Also bought goat liver.. It has strong taste .. May be I'm unlucky again😂 Anyway this is new city and I haven't trusted found hq food sources except for dairy I love kidneys.And I love urine...😂😂😂 Sorry.....wrong botton pressed.No lecture OoohhhWe were waiting for you Ground Beef sticks in the fridge 10 days,4,62
365,Are they good for eating between meals?. I'd better stick with liver this case Mine milk at 19 and i get there when they milk.. I get it just milkedMu farmers milk the cows at 7  and at 17.. I go at this times to get it still hot 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Better asking on person than by email no but the farmer might think u are weird for asking,4,68
366,"Ring are you concerned that someone might think you  are weird?. It might not be what you want to here What did he sau This is my energy drink Thats a strange reply imo no, cos a customer has the right to know that’s cos they think u ate questioning their quality are they are driven by regulations maybe u shld tell them what u want Think about how weird you gotta be to sell milk Milk people are fucked Obv i drink a shitton of milk Interesting",2,88
367,"How do you like it?. Having no compass on nutrition/health was a very big concern for me.. I had no grave illness but still too much of a fluctuating health for my taste and I'm a big eater, I would not stop eating at some points, so this was an issue I would never satiate on cheese, mayo, cakes, meat, sometimes eggs.. Eating 2 pizzas in one meal, a whole bottle of cream to cook the chicken, etc Now I find this diet entertaining.. there are many cool recipes to try out and I like them.I will see if in years all the cheese I eat detoxes so much I see changes in my eye patterns and colors.",5,118
368,"What about you @ubeats1 ?. So not a hard trigger like grave illness that is handicaping and worsening, but you wanted more stamina",2,23
369,"How was the transition?. Progressive?. Or jumped into it?. Would you have given it a try if someone came to you and right off the bat told you raw meat and such?. Is an idea i thought for my son to take to university when he stays all day and has no xtra time to eat I got fat and I wanted to try fasting because animals can so why couldn't I.. Also other humans do it and it was a challenge.. I suspected it could be spiritual and healthy too.Did it for 2 months with some refeed days.Then I needed to start eating again so I searched online as usual and went down the rabbit hole from the subject I left years ago.. I found low carb, keto, intermittent fasting, carnivore (Sean Malstrom's blog introduced me), and among those Stanley Owsley then Aajonus.. In his Q&A sessions, available to members of WeWant2Live website.. Easy to transport and light Hm should be good but adding some honey to it would help to resupply bioactive enzymes (driness disables enzymes, which is why raw unsalted cheese doesn't digest) Yes it dried Tastes like salami Ten days in fridge open air",10,198
370,How come it looks so dark.. Dry aged?. when you started wondering These.,3,13
371,"Is 10days in fridge  old ground beef sticks good for eating while walking?. wow cool 😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂 and sell cooked butter yes he said any dried food would bind some toxins, cheese the most for relationship Aajonus says to get fat haha.. protects from toxins and gets rids of bad mood, depression some say it is a genocidal intent, others experiment, others religious fanaticism, others devil possession, others for greed&money only that we experience suffering and they will become grainy grannies faster 👍👍.i try to give my kids rare meat rare egg and fernented milk if they want to drink.. Best thing to eat with cooked food is a lot of fat and minerals, so butter, cheese, vegetable juice, to bind with toxins coming out of it.",4,127
372,I don't get the eating cheese part though.. Raw unsalted cheese is not digestible except if honey and then it is not a fast digesting food?,2,26
373,"So cooked eggs don't mix with fermented meat?. Yes most digestible foods, good for quick energy, seem to be egg, fermented milk, raw butter + honey (+ a bit of unripe pineapple/papaya) Ok.then i coukd use it for a quick snack between meals I would not mix them with cooked meat Even if a chew little cheese when running slow, I feel bad.Better sucking them",2,65
374,Is it ok to eat with a cheese omelette   ten days fernented ground beef sticks?. You need the energy to walk.. You should not wasting it in the digestion.There are a lot of other moments to do it Thanks for that!. Hopefully it's all so it gets after afterwards,4,49
375,"What do you think of eating organs, fat and bone marrow from animals that are vaccinated?. No.The moment to.eat meat is after walking.. Not during an exercise.Only whey, or milk or sucking little pieces of cheese I think money is a big one, in the sense that profit seems to be the driving force that gets a lot of these unhealthy practices/ideas going in the first place.. But there definitely seems to be more than just money at play.. I can’t help but see just how wrong literally everything is and think there’s something more sinister.. I see an overarching theme of power and control where multiple motivations seem to coincidentally intertwine.. My question is just how orchestrated everything is far from nature, and wanting to get emancipated from it.Like transhumanism.. Interesting topic, but before transcending life at least master what it can do.. Tribes today are better nutritionists that top chemists, books written 3000 years ago have better health advice than most expensive clinics, etc more and more cooked and processed and synthetic.. on the other end civilization was already drifting before this It seems deliberate, I think it is modern biowarfare and social engineering.",10,196
376,"Probably many of them are true and get used on some level but which one controls  them all?. You know there is the idea that we are a controlled study.. Primitive tribes nearly don't know illness.. But we have discovered so many illnesses thanks to toxicity and deficiencies in our environment and body!. I know someone who can't eat cucumber.... or many vegetables, it will be painful to digest people who are very ill are indeed good indication of health, they will react to slightest toxin Aajonus believed he had all those illnesses so he could figure out better the path to health.... as in his role in life.. like the Passion of Christ ahah I tend to forget about it but standard diet gave me issues.. Headaches, acid reflux, etc., problem sleeping and now it's as if I never had it, incredible Foto de Antón Leitón grains give.... migraine Hi everyone 9/10 girls is nice, but finding organic may be hard haha Raw We should continue from him and make our own discoveries @antonleiton Is that cheese 100% unsalted?. First time I would see one with rind and all with absolutely no salt.. Cheese makersI asked say it spoils before that And meat",12,204

Perhaps they have suppliers that do for them though The Riviera Raw Unsalted cow cheese, fresh but hard, 60% water You were faster :) @ubeats1 This company is a coop of people who were the last ones to make the Laguiole cheese.. They managed to save it by grouping and developping.. The unsalted cheese is just the young version of it.. It's fresh but hard because it's been pressed so it is 60% humidity only.",6,100
378,Which one was it?. I live in France and this is it :https://www.jeune-montagne-aubrac.fr/fr/tome-fraiche/index.php I left it 2 weeks on the fridge price* then it can have twice more water so that would explain why half the time,2,37

However even if from ""raw milk"" it is a ""cooked paste"" cheese.... So it is only cooked at like 50°C but when it is no longer milk, so they call it raw haha.. Our raw goat butter mire expensive😒 This guy avoided being with people.. I don't remember exactly but he was a landscape artist as it allowed him to do this.. I think he was quite asocial and didn't like others, he was also depressed also consider Aajonus saying high eggs are an aphrodisiac.... which rich old Chinese mean spend 1000$ for and they are very active for a month afterwards hehe somehow this could get more people to eat this diet than nutrition I don't dare tallow becsuse my animals are not organic.i havevto find out if the are given antibiotics Amazing information Becsusey it has fat and meat Steak tartare 😋 Me too.. It's cheap I eat gound beef mostly Yeah he was saying bacteria, fermenting is very good, but that fresh food is necessary too.Because fresh good feeds mostly the parts of the body that get nutrition quicker and fermented feeds the ones that usually get none.Except if you eat 2pounds of high meat everyday like one of his clients.. He cured his social problems from this, became constantly funny and got 4 9/10 girlfriends harem according to Aajonus.. If you're unsure just eat fresh food and keep some on the side that you less ferment/get moldy/get predigested by parasites/insects/...Eat some of the fermenting milk, meat or egg, a piece every day or so.. Each day or so you will see a taste change.. No.. This has a little saltI have 1 in the fridge unsalted Oh wow.... More complexity added... More range of delicious food So many cheeses are actually never raw because of this: mozzarella, ricotta, emmental, etc.@antonleiton If I couldn't get raw butter I would ask for more fat trimmings from the butcher.. If not possible then more raw eggs.. If still not then fermented raw milk.. But I like butter",19,372

384,"Am I the only one who loves plain butter?. Really?. :O I eat 100g of beef fat, 6 eggs and 1l of fermented milk everyday I always liked some butter but I would get overwhelmed pretty quickly compared to the quantities I eat now.Possibly because it's raw and the body's metabolism may have shifted from diet change.. And 4 tablespoons of raw creamBut i think that all are complementary Yes Aajonus was saying each fermentation stage of food had a different use lol",4,83
385,"Is it better pasteurized butter or no butter?. There is a healthy way to do it I don't eat carbs just honey snd milk I have medgol dates Raw cheesecake.. because mixing foods they will be more stored as fat and less digested Receipt please Perfect.. You should gain weight with this.but if you drink fresh milk cold it will make you gain weight the wrong way, because the milk will not digest properly and be considered toxic because casein and lactose molecules go in the blood whole and are stored as fat.and it's better to sip because liquid too fast goes to the kidneys and the rest of nutrients separated from it are harder to process I drink cold the fermented milk and whey.Raw milk only the day i buy it and I don't put it in the fridge Raw honey, raw cream, raw cheese, raw whole egg, raw fruits, some dates or nut formula (nice crust).Nut formula = heavy anxiety and anger hormone detoxifier and takes care of carb craving.. 100g powdered raw nuts, 100g butter, 2teaspoons honey, 1 egg, delicious ""praliné""-like cream/biscuit and very filling",5,188

Will help detox.You can ferment milk so it becomes yoghurt/clabbered, more solid and add fresh (cottage-like) cheese and this makes raw cheesecake.Add nut formula (max 1 serving a week) for a biscuit to accompnay Yes, especially in nut formula because it binds with the toxins..

""Meat fat is not bad"" on the news my butcher told me (I rarely watch TV anymore) Tell me if i can help!. Crazy day full of antibiotics.My mom is sick.I enjoyed you chat.. but Keto is a good gateway to get to Primal.. Many of us probably did.. It's a first step.. It's a component of Primal I'd say which is more encompassing, it's what I found it to be.. Keto is only focused on low carb, a big issue, but Aajonus research went much deeper I promise this idea will make lots of money see ya!.

Both It makes moisturising/lubrication formula, which is very important as the only way Aajonus gave to get fats to areas of the body that usually don't get deserved (joints, etc)The egg yolk and butter are very digestible fats.the proteins in egg (white) help digest the fats and egg proteins digest the fastest, they're liquid so no hydrochloric acid or enzymatic action required, juste bacteria infiltrating it and it will go into blood from 5 first inches of intestine.The unheated honey helps digest protein with insulin-like substance secrete in bee vommit.The lemon juice helps digests fat further.. Hm probably like marinating meat or used as drops to ferment dairy faster, the bacteria feed on this acid agent, develops and then there is more to predigest the fats This would most probably be useful on dates yes and a nice butter perfume :) Maybe some....

Became a landscape artist so he didn’t have to be with people.. He went on and off the diet for a year and I said, “Listen.. You have to try the high meat just one time to get out of this depression so you can stay on the diet.”  So he tried it but didn’t call me..

409,Is toxic?And pasteurized cheese too?. Goat butter guys forced me😊 Thanks I made fermented butter Anton Good idea Was funny experience the point of moisturizing formula is that butter is very digestible fat and all the other ingredients are to speed up its digestion so it gets to starving body parts instead of  the usual first served.cream is much more complex to digest.however pasteurised butter wouldn't work either and is toxicso cream Yes raw cream,2,75

You will digest them more as they dried and many enzymes are no longer bioactive ; truly unheated honey supplies bioactive enzymes to help digest proteins (which themselves help tremendously digest fats) I don't eat and would advise against it..

439,DOnt you think it is better to alternate between fresh and rotten?. Detox pizza hmm This is my raw unsalted Or eat muscle meat However honey is dried predigested flower nectar (very low moisture which is why it keeps for months) and dried meat is also defficient in water.Perhaps eating a bit of butter with it which is high in water (60%) could avoid internal driness afterwards.(I used to experience this when eating 1-2pounds of cheese a day only.... after finishing the Parmesan especially some coughing and driness in throat),3,90
440,And creamif i don't have water?,1,6
441,"And eating it with beef fat?. However cream impairs meat digestion by half if it's not soured.. If the cream is soured it's predigested.Cream is one of most complete animal fat, it contains butter + 30% more different cholesterols which are responsible for feeding the brain and nervous system, so it's important, but difficult to digest.It will coat meat and you will find undigested meat leaving your body, pink parts in white pearls of cream.. Dry meat and cream is great Mucus is good because it transports toxins out of your body.. I had mucus for months then almost none anymore no matter how much dairy I eat (pounds and liters at once).Though if you do raw unsalted cheese, lymphatic baths you will detox much more efficiently and with needing much less mucus (you can even get no more flus etc for this reason while still detoxing unlike medicines which halt the detox symptoms by adding further toxicity on the body overloading it and making it give it up as it has to manage the new toxicity) or in moisturizing formula the lemon will offset the taste pbbly If you eat a lot of honey it will store some glycotoxins but as your digestion improves you should crave less of it.As for cream a lot is needed to be too much.... then it can become demineralizing according to Aajonus.BUT some people actually need huge amounts of it for awhile.. Yes beef fat or cream, especially cream lot of water content, still has some whey inside",7,255
442,What do you think about running?. Is it healthy or wastes energy that can be used to clean my body?. and if you eat only a little bit of it at once you can maybe digest most of it But better introducing high meat in a progresive way,3,48
443,And just some grey mucus came out of my mouth ... coincidence?,2,12
444,How much is too much?!?. With nHoney butter ir cream ...... delicious I fiun out i can get addicted to dry beef sticks 😢😢😢😭,3,24
445,"And with cream also ok?. Tastes good Good food, never enough",2,11
446,"How much milk?. Aajonus said on a good diet physical exercise is not bad.. Some people need it.. Some ill people are too ill yet to do anything more than walking or sometimes not even, need to recover in bed.Good because it uses overproduced hormones that would lead to stress, anger if not used in physical activity and also ""degenerate the body"" said Aaj.Good because it improves nutrient circulation.Good because it makes you feel good, psychological effect on health is also important.. through hormones, EM waves, and more things from the uncharted psycho-somatical/spiritual aspect.But make sure to eat enough.Also it creates lactic actid which requires minerals to get cleaned, so need to drink whey after for example.. Ok Yes it will correct a little overacidity from cooked meat.. dairy is slightly alkalizing because of its mineral content",7,137
447,"I give my kids rare meat and they like to drink fermented milk with it.Is that ok?. well it gives you time to prepare it :) if you eat fermented dairy it's also better 30min after meat meal probably some meat proteins will have digested by then and will speed up moisturizing formula assimiliation but i'm not sure Ok!. I must set the alarm...😅😅 Not useless, it is just optimal about 25min after a meat meal",3,76
448,If i wait more time is useless?. without exercise also it makes you gain lean mass Yes better indeed.. Pasteurized butter wouldn't work for moisturizing anyway Yes and if you ever want to lose weight just eat one raw egg at least every 5h and it will all drop off very fast without side effects from fasting or caloric restriction I will do that I guess raw fermented cream us better than pasteurized butter I lost a lot in crdivegan diet 5kilos.And i have fasted for four days with urine and lost weigh too Now i hsve better eat and nurture my body Oh yes definitely.. 25min after a meat meal for best absorption.. it is delicious and feed all your poorly deserved body parts.However it needs to be butter otherwise it will not digest fast enough.Still if you do it with cream you will still get a good recipe that is not useless Great.... they prefer meat s bit cooked,6,161
449,"I guess i can drink  with the raw meat what is left of cream when making butter?. I think so If it makes a good quantity though you can take it 30min after the meat meal with honey, by itself if there is enough or with other dairyit will digest better and also be more filling",2,56
450,Like this?. Tastes great!. That is amazing....i was worried it was spoiled because i bought 2kiloss similar I put it outside and didn't check for days or weeks Great coaching.Thanks a lot!. Thanks!. But no butter is the deal now... I did that!. My baby butter why?. it will put public water toxic chemicals and wash away good nutrients,8,59
451,"Shall i wash the butter in water?. I'm still waiting for mine to turn blue.. However it apparently tastes similar to blue cheese.I can tell you maggot goat cheese tastes like gorgonzola and a bit spicy on tongue The goat butter i had got moldy.Blue stains i ate some Great!. also if you let butter get moldy, like blue cheese, it gets predigested by mold, and you absorb 96% of it, 25% more than normal butter Thanks!",4,77
452,"That was my second thought...can i just sore it?. May be i should drink more lubrication formula I just made my first fermented butter!.. Raw fats on your body will look less fat than cooked fat, however, to really be fat like Aajonus 30% and look 16% it takes several years on diet because at first the tissues need to hydrate and so they space up a little to make way for delivery of nutrients and it doesn't look trim, but still less fat than cooked Ohhhh Perhaps.. Aajonus said you could use coconut cream if you want but said the dairy cream was wasted.. Not sure.. I don't use it.. Prefer to eat it, it probably feeds me more than being spread throughout water IMO after the bath YES I used to wake up sweating and feeling bad.. Now after a few months I am always much more clean even if not bathing 2 days sometimes.Also after a really hot bath 90min or more the zen feeling is incredible.. It can also give so much energy at the same time 2tablespoons of salt.Milk 2 cups is enough.Use skim milk because the cream is useless and waste in the bath.It is the minerals that bind with toxins.The toxins from the water with chemicals inside and the toxins coming out of your body.Salt also binds with some of them and it won't enter your skin because it's too big a mineralThey bind with them so you don't absorb them.. I do baths everyday there is ""wax"" coming out of me.. For a while I had palpitations and cramps in heart, hands, and tingling feeling with ""pops"" on skin.It made grey slightly yellow/black stains on the bathtub.. Didn't thought about that 👍👍 too small place",12,293
453,So it is just for one person.Better not that another nember of the family also uses it?,1,17
454,Me too.Is the water and milk full of toxins after the bath?,1,12
455,"You rinse yourself with water after the bath?. I may use the cubes to stand 90m With 37 c i could stand 20mts in salted water Ok I had lost all my weight with fasting and when I did weigh gain on Primal I could compare very easily, for same weight on previous diet I looked 1.5times fattier perhaps First 45min only gets rid of body waste under the skin.After that it only STARTS melting and gets to the congestion in the lymphatic system, nodes (main ones in your neck, armpits, crotch, etc.) Yes I used to wake up with strong odor and I never managed to get  rid of body odor in my bedroom except with good wind blowing through the window, now it has reduced a lot even after a night of sleep.. So I have better air  to breathe too!",3,143
456,"45 is enough to melt oils?. But how much?....i have slways weighed 35 when i was omnivorous Cooked fats are liked balloons, big but not heavy.. It's swollen fat.Raw is denser Thanks sooo much for dtails.I must get fat I get ground beef becsuse it had both and i can't find butter",3,52
457,"I understand now i can get fatter but look the same ....but the scale has to show the weigh i get even if i look skiiny?. Nice.. I think the area of improvement if you want is getting fattier cuts of meat.. Also raw eggs Aajonus was 30% bodyfat but looked 16% Cooked fat is bigger than raw fat, cooking make it swell 20/100 times.So if you eat cooked fat for the same energy you look fatter, more volume.Raw fat is smaller molecule, concentrated, dense and more firm.. I don't understand sorry I eat raw ground beef mostly.Ommekette cheese and fermented milk Maybe it is me..... Tiger is invisible..... I just smell it Did you make it taste your food?. It can perhaps be a very good judge of quality if you lose fat then put on raw fat it will be heavier but less volume, so you can be fat and look normal or even trim if you've been long enough on the diet to have many tissues regenerated That happens to us.There us a tiger sleeping in my bedroom and i have to open the windows so that it leaves and enough to feel comfortable in bath.. the fat surrounding you will arrest toxins and there will be less uncomfortable symptoms about 10pounds overweight Not for me.A friend of our Spanish group was worried because she is gaining weigh and we told her about the eggs.She wanted to know if she has to eat just raw eggs the whole day Pulling out toxins of the bodyNeutralizing toxins of the water 👍👍👍 the minerals and some nutrients in vinegar bind to poisons/toxins in natural hot spring it isn't necessary but it is in public water with chemicals in it Ok",9,291
458,"Rom  to loose weigh only eat raw eggs.nothing else?. 👍👍 Yo yo yo Ok.She can decide what to do Breakfast time :D Papaya + raw cream 😂😂😂Me, too One raw egg at a time yes Either 1 raw egg or a golfball-sized amount of lean meat each time when hungry She wants to loose weight and to eliminate toxins at the same time",2,63
459,"What is the salt vinegar and milk for?. yes she can alternate Sup primal ppl The amount of salt is not much.. Make cheesecake with whatever you have available.. Just mixing together cream, egg, honey (fresh) cheese or clabbered milk, and using a few fruits for topping and nut formula as the base.. All of us i guess...",5,58
460,"Any in the cream?. I don't know ....Could be my pocket?. I have to watch up Sorry about the mess .... 👍👍 I could try with fermented milk that is quite solid.Thanks for the tip.. Nut formula worked And relaxed me i like your videos Obviously it is written in binary code Beautiful cheeses snd butter 😂😂😂😂 Enjooooy Lick it🤷‍♀ Ah, somebody going to have some great time with all this dairy👌👌 You take yout jar",5,76
461,Was it raw then?,1,4
462,"ALone or with honey?. I like to suck fermented milk with a straw.. And the egg white.. And then, drink the yolk Me too😊",4,24
463,How much is 2 quick pours?. Guess not,2,8
464,"Just put some nut formula in the cream and freeze it for a while?. Talked to my farmer yesterday when I have trouble finishing one serving I add more cream on it to have a ""fresh"" taste :) And with cresm us perfect I love cream with yolk snd honey.... ice-cream as a cake crust it's top level pastry And with nut firmula is better it can also make ice cream too, little chunks in cream and solidify in cold Nut formula was cold too.Funny taste like these ""dough"" ice creams A pity I don not havemuch butter Is amazing and so easy to prepare oh yes uhuh freezing ice cream overnight but if not eating it in the 24h it loses nutrients.freezing anything else except some fish will destroy like 80% of nutrients frozen is nice texture but it will have less flavor than at ambient temp for a few hours So better not.That is what i supposed.i thought it destroys 20%  not 80% that is too much.i was mistaken.. Thank you also Aajonus recommends MAX 2 times a week (a serving = with 100g of nuts) and once a month is more reasonable.doing more can cause too much detox.. also it is still a starch and will accumulate AGE glycotoxins if overdone.The egg white also goes in it I made half recipe to check the taste.and i didn't have much butter.I understand you can't eat that everyday😅 No unsalted cheddar cheese available and vanilla extract organic is quite expensive here i think Not to sweet true It is fulfilling haha ok Getting some fresh t bones She is also going to get me larger primal cuts to dry age Gonna dry age in my fridge Like me and Anton She thinks it is becsuse ishe lives milk Loves milk Ok.I tell her.Thanks If she drinks her milk cold when it's not fermented it makes her gain because it's not digested properly 😳😳😳 Was sucking eggs last night and trying to keep it easy",5,335
465,"Sooo if i want to get weigh i could drink cold milk?. because whole lactose and casein molecules get into the blood undigested, which is toxic, which is why they're quickly stored as fat better just mix ingredients together like moisturising formula or cheesecake Ok moisturising formula will be the only thing that feeds joints and badly deserved body parts so if you don't mind gaining some weight it will be very beneficial I made a small amount of nut firmula and ate it with yolk cream and honey",2,89
466,Were there effects?. Not yet....i ate it after an ommelette,2,10
467,were you overly anxious?. No.... I was mostly thursty and felt like a want sweet taste at the end it's not a great way to do it,3,27
468,How was the recipe?. My mum is still with respiratory infections,2,11
469,Virus keyboard?,1,2
470,Nut are nuts and hazel nut or pecans?,1,8
471,"Do i have to put them in water for 8h before use?. Yes but for weight loss the raw unsalted cheese must be really dry or you will probably still digest some of it.. No soaking, the unheated honey takes care of the enzyme inhibitors in it as long as it's well mixed.. butter is necessary to catch the gluten that will bind to overproduced hormones causing anxiety/anger Great because since crdivegan i hate soskying seeds😅 Any of those are fine.. Nuts are  pecans   or   walnuts,   pine   or   hazel   nuts,sunflower or pumpkin seeds, or peanuts, or a blend of hose.Almond could work however much harder to digest I think walnuts are the easiest to find raw in supermarket",5,118
472,I have hazelnuts!. I do it today or tomorrow....does it stand in fridge?. yes,3,14
473,I can leave it 3 days ?. yep Do i have itcready for when stress comes indeed Thank you!. I dont think you would need it It is like nutella This just came to my conscious: when i swallow mucus from bronchs and lungs this bringing toxins back to my digestive system and they get absorbed again...,3,57
474,"Does coffe grinder grind hazelnuts?. Don't worry.. Aajonus said you can swallow mucus, it is already isolated and will not be reabsorbed even if you don't expectorate it Nut formula for anxiety, anger or starch cravings that won't go away.1 serving:100g raw nuts you powder yourself100g butter2teaspoons honey1 eggblend together until it makes a paste But i don't mind Feemented butter us kess sweet Then i found raw milk and you guys Yes.. I have had cravings since the beginning of the diet and try to eat more fat but it is difficult because I cant get raw cream or butter.I don't like tallow so much When under stress my sugar needs go up like a drug addict😂 I try to eat raw fermented cream before 16 and 20 h to prevent cravings I love dairy",4,136
475,"Im drinking beer, is that primal?. Maybe ill switch to a gin and urine I can try...is just that under stress my need seems to make me crash with my molars and honey is soft , so i thought to eat cream and honey before i get so stressed that i need to crash something hard.. 😁😁😁Animal kingdom is amazingOur own blood 😳😳😅 I have cold and a lot of mucus.The only change was 2 eggs alone in the morning in spite of milkshake U may not be keto adapted yeat.How long have u been in a LCHF lifestyle?. cheers I do experience much more mucus in area of larynx/esophagus for past 2-3 months (since starting more raw) Probably detoxing pollutants which got in bronchial tree and lungs As long as I always lived in city with lots of heavy metal/chemical industry This is annoying.. I have to speak with people everyday.. I losing my voice sometimes because of this Maybe two months.During Christmas i failed and ate sugar Thanks group.Support is also a great help I did the meat broth for some time yes.When i stopped fruits and veggies and didn't know AV I ate cooked meat and chucrut for some time.I kove my home made chucrut NOPE, beer = liquid Bread.Try vodka Wow My adolescent kids during exams are stressful too and it made me eat confort food many times..... now i think I have the clue of what to eat when my junky brain wants shit sugar..

Howeve I naturally got a craving for raw ground beef like steak tartareand the black angus grass fed I get I tried both cooked and raw, raw much better, it has rich favors like herbs I found a butcher that grows own cattle.Grass fed, no stables and only fed with corn and barley the last three months.No antibiotics or vaccines..

594,"Does anyone have the sport formula recipe?. From Aajonus book: SCURVY is a form of malnutrition, characterized by swollen and  bleeding gums, rough dry discolored skin, tenderness of joints and  muscles, bruising easily, poor healing of wounds, and susceptibility to  frequent detoxification (infections, parasites, virus, etc.).. Scurvy occurs  in individuals who lack the ability to assimilate cooked sugars and  cooked fat properly.. A lack of enzyme-mutations for eating cooked  yellow foods is sometimes also a factor in scurvy.. (Cooked yellow  foods in some people rob blood sugars that are needed throughout the  body.)   Avoiding cooked and processed sugars and fat and cooked yellow  foods settles scurvy.. Eating plenty of fresh unripe fruit and fresh  parsley leaves usually relaxes symptoms in a few days.. Eating plenty of  unheated honey helps the utilization or elimination of stored processed  sugars (such as glycogen).. Then eating a balanced raw diet that  includes raw meat corrects scurvy.. I have a theory.. Could my hunger be from the fact I've always ate too little.. When I eat cooked food I get this full feeling.. I'm physically impaired an hour after the meal because of it.. The cooked meat obviously doesn't digest fast and stays in the stomach for a long time occopying space and for that reason I'm not hungry anymore.. But with raw, it digests very fast.. I get sated but not full.. Maybe my body has always needed more food since I'm growing but the physical fullness has blocked me from eating more.. And blocked my body's hunger signal evem though I might be starving and in 2000kcal deficit.. Like fiber.. Makes sense Yes.I think we have talked about this beforeI think we are starving.. And you, even more Hmmm.. The whole meats in the burcher shop have a very grass-fed color fat in them.... Maybe they buy grain fed suet.... :( Nah, different looks in areas of beef Every fat of beef isn't yellow, I noticed it also from chicken when I slaughtered a well treated pasture raised chicken The vitamin A scaremongering is programmed deep inside me.... And it doesn't help my parents usually tell how one of their supposed friends was hospitalised after vitamin A overdose.. They didn't tell me tho if it was synthetic or natural vitamin A Sure i've read fatal case of consuming polar bear liver as it has too much vit A for human consumption Can you eat liver every day if you eat lots of herring and drink fish head smoothie™¿ haha yes but it goes to show there can be overdose of vit a and A esp vit c Well thankfully I'm not eating polar bear",25,441

They can replace cereals for those who miss crunchiness, hehe lucas Go through the files available for this chat ull find aajonus books in pdf format Tranny fly eating cheese Probably not a tranny fly I think its a he Tastyyyy :p Aajonus makes us eat enough fat to delay sugar digestion and avoid sugar spikes Woot And finally, bacteria is tantamount.. Fermented food, dairy, eggs, and even high meat.Even parasites are considered a blessing in this diet, as AV defends the idea that bacteria, fungus, ""parasites"", etc.. are janitors of the body, they only clean damaged tissues and toxins, and all we have to do is eat enough raw meat torebuild good new tissue when they clear the way :) Aajonus found a little unripe pineapple/papaya (unripe is better because more enzymes and less sugar), has enzymes to help digest proteins, as well as bone development.. This is helpful to some people.another discovery: raw unsalted cheese is undigestible and will be used to pull toxins instead, so it is another staple food, to eat a cube 10min before any other food so it doesn't mix with the poisons, and even by itself every 15min!. With this AV claims some of his patients healed of very toxic conditions (heavy metal poisoning all over their body and organs) in a fraction of time.. Primal Diet has a lot of emphasis on detoxification programs, but always hand in hand with rebuilding your body.For example raw meat taken with pure fat makes sure your body uses the meat for rebuilding instead of fuel according to Aajonus.There are remedies to feed body parts that are starving for nutrients because they are last fed in the chain, such as joints: called moisturizing/lubrication formula.. egg+melted but raw butter,1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon unheated honey.. this is designed to digest the fat super fast so it gets to these parts before others take it.. Also unheated honey is one of staple foods.. It is an animal product.Bees swallow flower nectar and convert 90% of sugar in it into enzymes, but as soon as the honey gets heated above 33°C it reverts back to sugar He says digestion is 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbs.. The body can make carbs but if you're having a lot of fat it seems you can up the carbs a little for example, even though proteins are a better choice Im struggling with the rind on this one I have a fly come for my cheese Very strong flavour Also if you mostly eat meat, especially raw, you won't have deficiencies.. A blood sample test will show you have all the necessary vitamins, minerals, trace metals, etc.Even vitamins which are supposedly only found in plants on the Internet (like B9) show up when upping meat consumption the best mold I had on cheese was a green one.... the brown and sometimes white stains seem to be the stronger tasting ones Juicing is for hydration, and a medicine as well.. Our body from environmental pollution and bad diet is riddled with toxins.. This makes our terrain over-acidic in our bloodstream, digestive system.. Some vegetable juice, taken 1h apart from meat, balances the pH to a normal acidic level.Also, the natural bacteria from the juice will get rid of some residues of past cooked and processed vegetables of same kind wasteproducts still in us.Plus, it is a supplement of enzymes, minerals, vitamins.Vegetable are to be juiced and not fruits (except in some rare circumstances) because of lower carb content.. Except some bland fruits like tomato cucumber zucchini considered ok Me too.. But I think the taste is worse molds develop well too.. I think Aajonus puts the berries in the fridge to make them moldy (heavy metal remedy, claims he cured autism in 2 years with it instead of 6 usually) only to avoid them fermenting into alcohol, but the mold would also develop on them out of the fridge probably for mesophile bacteria i think it's faster out",22,758
596,"Should be fresh cheese stored in fridge or out of it to get cured?. balance between food and medication?. 😝 Yep, sometimes I wait more and another mold will give it another flavor.Or let worms predigest it it will become creamy and a different kind of strong well balanced between health and sickness..

I try to add all the important recipes step by step even better if you have the special dry-aging ""fridge"" butchers use for meat, it will be perfect for this medicinal cheese, it will dry it and prevent molding yes it's not bad.. and if you let it outsid only 2 days it gets dry",4,70
626,"How did it work out?. ahah You plug it like an electric car when sitting on your chair It would be cool to have a Primal(R) drip, you put on your head or shoulder, and a straw feeds you one droplet every min but onlt 60% moisture oh also lubrication formula.. It is a liquid but only fat (melted butter), so it satisfies this guzzling feeling and is very satiating the best thing I have found is this homemade yogurt/cream.. it still hasnearly all water but somehow solidified.... so its not (I think) a liquid that will rush too fast, but it is hydrating for a while, then I can resume very small sips because I am not thirsty yes I will try this but it's very hard for me, I like to drown myself in drinks :( Also since cheese is more concentrated, it would take more poisons at once and a cube is bigger than a sip.... so I would theorically divide the sip by 3 or 4, like every 10 or 5min a very little sip :D because you have less water at a time and poisons can get dumped at least this frequently I think it could work even better with an even smaller sip every 15min the Japanese would do it aka hot springs on the go yes :) Aka a drysuit filled with hot water I also imagined the bathtub body suit..

All other members of my family were vaccinated and they also dont have allergies No.. I have played at 50%.. Couldn't breath well when starting.4 little pieces of cheese.. Improved a little while playing.. 1h15min.Stronger chest pain today.. And they shoot me just in the chest with a ball.. Lucky that wasn't too strong Usually, midcenter.. Like Kross, but with less quality.. Today, defender.. Like Sergio Ramos of course ive been vaccinated i just didnt read your message before responding fucking vaccinated how could we have been so foolish!. Asthma crisis now.. And i have to play football in 30min i had to be vaccinated last year to be able to travel to africa 😰 I did Hypertension and hyperhidrosis, but not extreme.. Both were reduced when i lost weight Also i cant see well from far, but i noticed i see better when im fasting.. I think it also has to do with my hypertension Nothing else that i know Im retarded thats my chief health issue Rarely Nop i like my skin, only my face gets dry after showering which is normal i guess Children growing up today in Western countries get 40+ vaccines.. In the U.S.. over 70+ Nothing dramatic that can be directly traced to vaccines.. But I sense that the ~20 vaccines I have received in my life have played a role in retarding my development.. When I received my last ""mandatory"" vaccinations, 3 at the same time at age 19 and one flu vaccine a bit later, 7 months later my skin erupted with scars oozing yellow puss and hardening on my skin forming thick crusts.. Almost my whole face and a bit of my hands and legs were covered in it.. This lasted for 10 days in addition to fever, and aches.. I attribute this to detoxing the vaccines, nothing else makes sense for how I would have gotten that ""sickness"" other than the slightly moldy air that I breathed for those 7 months.. Except my sister.. She is allergic to some plants like basilicum and some foods Today I'm better off than most of my peers thanks to primal diet 😄 The only allergy i noticed was when i rided a horse, and it disappeared after some time 😂 Nothing special.... only stomach bloating after eating much peanuts, or beans, or mixing different foods I dont have a farm near me great little Salted high supermarket cheese works better for me than home made unsalted 3 weeks out of the fridge one",27,535

I cut it and eat it with honey 30mim after the meals Send you photos in the evening strange :o Me, too This is the moldy outside closed I let it open to dry air in fridge aajonus says to air about every 4 days or each week to renew the air so mold can develop Closed or opened but leave 2/3 of the jar empty for airspace 1 month out of the fridge in a plate.. 1 week in the fridge in a plate Like the high meatI keep it outside the fridge yeah it may be better, but the smell is the issue but even if it comes out I think he said it will maybe still not digest but still fractionate so toxins will be released",5,151

Replaced water with raw milk.",3,67

Fermented Milk makes my thirsty Salt is ""the next worst thing to cooking"" and will prevent the cheese from working for detox wait ""The reason you don’t want to do salt is that it is the most volatile explosive on the planet.. A block of isolated sodium this big would take out NYC.. GE was paid over two trillion dollars over the last 60 years by the military to make sodium - salt - an explosive that they could use as a war toy.. That was one of the projects that my father worked on.. Salt is so volatile that you can’t control it; more volatile than nitroglycerin.. A 1½ degree change can cause it to ignite.. That’s why they wanted it as a very efficient bomb because there’s no way to control it, which is a good thing.. They’ve given up for now.. We can do it bad enough with uranium and stuff like that.So when salt goes in your body and your body isolates the sodium molecule from the iodide or chloride – depending on what kind of salt you’re using – even if it’s a natural salt - it breaks the clusters of minerals up because it has to be in colloidal form to be absorbable into a cell as a nutrient.. So it has to be a uni-molecule of a mineral to be utilized properly.. When the cell eats normally, there’s a whole network – smorgasbord of nutrients – anywhere from 97 to 117 nutrients…all your vitamins…all your minerals, fats …all the 60 varieties of cholesterol that can be formed …all the different proteins – pyruvates – all 22 amino acids.. Everything is in this smorgasbord.. When a cell eats, it gets the whole dose and it’s completely nutrified.. When salt is eaten, it causes explosions of these nutrients so you may only get 27 or 57 of these nutrients into a cell at once.. So every cell becomes deficient any time you use salt with a meal.. Not only that, it dehydrates cells.. Sometimes the sodium molecules isolated will attach to each other – even though sodium molecules are the smallest of all the elements – when they clump together; they create a very strong magnetism.. So, when a cell opens, the magnetism is so strong it rips the ions out of the cell and the cell will never eat again.. It shrivels like a raisin from a grape.. So one million red blood cells are destroyed by one little grain of salt.. Of course, those cells would fit on the head of a pin.There was a group of guys that said that was bullshit and I didn’t know what I was talking about.. I said to take a freshly killed animal, skin it and salt it and see what happens.. They did.. You can go online and look up “frogs,” “salt” and “video.” [https://youtu.be/2YZJt_Bw3eo] These guys sprinkled salt – about what you would sprinkle on your dinner - on three frog legs.. The legs go into spasms.. The video only showed two minutes but the legs went on for 27 minutes.. Then they tried lots of pepper on one frog leg and it only gave one spasm.. Pepper is a highly caustic substance that burns tissue while salt is an explosive.. Dead or not, it starts mixing with certain bodily fluids and starts exploding.Salt is bad, bad, bad - the next worst thing to cooking.. However, in water you will not ingest, it helps neutralize things like fluoride and chlorine."" He says salt will fractionate the cheese and it won't hold onto toxins at alls.. Now cheese is usually salted throughout and not just in some parts there is an easy test eat some cheese and see if you poop it out if you don't, it's been digested.. it's not supposed  to be digested, except with enzymes (honey/fruits), salt or cooking The cheese is supposed to come out almost whole, even if you only eat this (no food excess) and even a little quantity of it (small cheese cube) not literal but you recognize it he properly explained it Life is easy:) Thanks for the info..

When I pâté my meat, really mince more than ground, I ate up to 4 pounds a day, all day and night long just eating in front of my computer fueling me with energy, and never had to go to toilets either, for 2 weeks (then I binged on some good fats because this was very lean meat)",6,244

I make really delicious cakes or pastes or whatever, with fresh cheese, yogurt, cream, honey, some fruits and nuts, eggs.... in a week that's 20pounds onWith meat, eggs, especially lean, it goes off pretty quick.. Eating meat with a lot of fat prevents that..

Will send you a video look at tommy in the gym holy fuck you fuckimg primal guys are tough as nails i got something to show you guys, one sec.. Damn I will do this because in the shell unlike meat and dairy it doesn't need any kind of plate or protection from insects, just throw in box better than Kinder Surprise Yes, they actually taste like cucumber after you chew them a couple times Raw ruminant just doesnt appeal to me nice, i love cucumber Deep squat position and hanging from the pull up bar should help us 🐥 Hows that taste Anyway, regarding your question : I don't go by numbers, instead I know that I have to get my energy from fat, so I try to eat that as much as my body wants and handles.. People say the fat / protein ratio should be 2:1, but there is no a precise way to tell.. For instance the ground meat I have been enjoying lately has good amount of fat in it.. I eat it with raw horse fat, so in total I have no idea how much it is.. Always have eggs and dairy raw tho",15,395

Now, I dont do it.. But it can be a powerful tool in my opinion.A lot of little meals during the day, another one Maybe it's a mineral deficiency because I have salt with cooked.. No salt with raw",8,127

There are nice people over there, too Yes I think aajonus an amazing human and knew alot.. But we should not act as if he was a god I personally think he was wrong about fasting.. Probably due to his bad experience with almost killing himself I totally agree, that part of waking up during the night and eat was quite funny to read 😁 I guess you are referring to me, anyway I remember reading one of his books and he said to eat even every 5h, so basically waking up to during the night and eat an egg or some milk.. Well, probably some people might benefit from such a routine, if done for a period of time I guess you are right That's a good idea creating this group!.

Maximum I would say is 100g-150g instead lean meat you can even eat 400-500g per sitting.. No, it was less I got severely constipated from 50grams of raw cheese.. No can do Have you tried a little piece every 15 min?. Like half a sugar cube If you want to try cutting out dairy go for it.. It could be the answer.. That's really good.. But for others like me all dairy will wreck my digestion (exept goat milk) Milk is quite high in sugar afterall Maybe the protein in it, lactose or even the sugar Eating a little piece of cured unsalted or little salted cheese every 15 min is helping me Interesting Severe insomnia because of what exactly?. Worrying?. Or just too much serotonin tell your doctor to go get updated on cholesterol Ancel Keys dogmas from the NEW MEDICAL INQUISITION / ISLAMIC MEDICAL FUNDANMENTALISM I just found out an interesting info about fat/protein ratio..

Trying to keep it for a month and then loosing it all.. Doing the Aajonus bulk/cut cycle Warm milk is easy to digest and it doesn't become sour for 12-24 hours even when warm..

Went keto after and gained ally lost muscle back Great 👍🏼 and good progress on the pullups Nice mate👍💪 must be a good feeling getting on the right tracks health wise Being outside, breathing fresh air, and having sunlight is also really big.. Major reason for having lots of stable energy now Been 95% raw for 6 months.. 2 times a month have had a cooked carnivore meal with cucumber/green salad.. Definitely agree, I'm in the UK and the winter effects me big time.. Really need to move to a warmer country Live even more up north, in Finland I do somewhat agree.. But think if your sick, the best healing will be in a warm sunny climate.. Once your healthy then yes seasons are cool Now there's +18h sunlight and soon 22-24h I agree on your sentiment too.. For healing, that's really good.. Had a week long detox of tonsillitis, and sinusitis now when warm weather arrived On a 1 rep max you will always round abit.. But for the most part it's straight Ah right , well yeah on a bad day it's literally hard to keep my head up But I always make sure I walk with good posture That's true.... Like a drug red pill stuff https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qlMS5t9abH4 i wasn’t breastfeed I love & appreciate the cycles.. During winter it is time to stop, relax, sleep, and reflect I dead 260kg, bench 135 kg and squat 180kg I'm going to try again with more raw milk , and let it sit out a few days before I drink it It gets better.. I'm coming off of chronic fatigue.. Raw milk 3-4L a day made it worse at start.. Still consuming lots of milk and the fatigue is slowly lifting, probably due to sunlight and vit D.. Very hard to make progress with the way I am atm Around 88-90kg 6 foot 3 Have a problem the last few months where my face goes very red.... Think it's high cortisol.. So cant push it too hard in the gym because I go purple ha plus the fatigue Deadlift conventional Taxas bar I think Texes think what it's called I'm built to dead lift.... My bench has always been a massive struggle And squat Yeah I need to include more fish Have some salmon roe",24,495
696,Are you fully raw ?. Whats your diet like now ?. Powerlifting is a great way to learn about your body and food Now it's just drugs ThanksI knew it but i need someone remembering me again and again.I hate to throw food on the garbage I lift 120kg in deadlifts..

Then rest for a hour or so and let it fully digests.. And fast the rest of the day.. Maybe have the odd snack if you feel the need Definitely a bad idea having a large meal late in the day i think True.. Thing is no one now has perfect health..

Apart from eventually I seem to crave so rare steak In a world this toxic and if you have some health problems Autophagy Feast famine cycles makes sense You think in nature you could just snack all day I think that vegetable juice are tóxic for us the only juice i do is ""sky juice"" 😛 But i think that some toxic products can help us to take out another poisons that we have in our bodies I am not doing them cause i have no timeBut i am drinking fruit juices, with coconut oil and raw cream I can't find organic ones..

708,"You against fasting?. Seems very natural to me Weak shitty versions are pushed like doing only a 16 hour fast Looks great True, will try again to fully cut it out This was my first long fast Shit guys, I tried several times during the last months to drink clabbered raw cow milk, but it doesn't make me feel good.. I feel digestion discomfort, lack of energy and sometimes even intestine cramps during the night.So it is a no go for me.. I feel better with goat milk Will try more liver for sure",4,94

People might give strange looks.. If you're lucky, some curious mind may approach you and inquire.. It creates mercury vapors To poison our nervous system as vaccines do lol Toxoplasmosis is a fake name in order to hide the poison of nervous system So if we fall on coma by car accident , chemical poison or something we are fucked up 😂😔 at least someone give us raw fats they will blame bacteria Acording to aajonus, the coma or paralysis are temporal, they will be gone when your body removes the poison and regenerate the tissue.. If you see pharmaceutical treatment on coma is extreme drugs and anestesias and by adittion we cannot regenerate nervous tissue with carbohydrates and cooked foods The governemnt made us eat canned foods I translate into english need to get darth vader masks Poor dogs and cats we have destroyed them with vaccines and canned foods lol Furano is in spanish 😂😂😂",10,355

It is too acidic and make me extremely thirsty I think that most people in this group respect all opinionsAnd especially if you are trying to help us to understand our body to achieve a long term better health Also unheated honey is one of staple foods.. It is an animal product.Bees swallow flower nectar and convert 90% of sugar in it into enzymes, but as soon as the honey gets heated above 33°C it reverts back to sugar and no fasting at all unlike many carnivore groups which go hand in hand with IF Juicing is for hydration, and a medicine as well.. Our body from environmental pollution and bad diet is riddled with toxins.. This makes our terrain over-acidic in our bloodstream, digestive system.. Some vegetable juice, taken 1h apart from meat, balances the pH to a normal acidic level.Also, the natural bacteria from the juice will get rid of some residues of past cooked and processed vegetables of same kind wasteproducts still in us.Plus, it is a supplement of enzymes, minerals, vitamins.Vegetable are to be juiced and not fruits (except in some rare circumstances) because of lower carb content.. Except some bland fruits like tomato cucumber zucchini considered ok Aajonus makes us eat enough fat to delay sugar digestion and avoid sugar spikes He says digestion is 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbs.. The body can make carbs but if you're having a lot of fat it seems you can up the carbs a little for example, even though proteins are a better choice Primal Diet has a lot of emphasis on detoxification programs, but always hand in hand with rebuilding your body.For example raw meat taken with pure fat makes sure your body uses the meat for rebuilding instead of fuel according to Aajonus.There are remedies to feed body parts that are starving for nutrients because they are last fed in the chain, such as joints: called moisturizing/lubrication formula.. egg+melted but raw butter,1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon unheated honey.. this is designed to digest the fat super fast so it gets to these parts before others take it.. Cool.. I currenty only eat raw grass-fed beef, nose to tail and drink water.. No plants or honey.. We have them share here And some audios and interviewsIf you send me your email, I will give you access Primal is raw carnivore + raw dairy.And another aids in detox like hot baths, fruit juice with fat, celery juice, etc f.nilenius@gmail.com Done Vegetable juices, 1 fruit meal a day, some olive oil/vinegar, those mainly for medicine, in moderation, almost always with animal fat, and less quantities of it needed as the years go (it becomes counterproductive to do as much then) Aajonus found a little unripe pineapple/papaya (unripe is better because more enzymes and less sugar), has enzymes to help digest proteins, as well as bone development.. This is helpful to some people.another discovery: raw unsalted cheese is undigestible and will be used to pull toxins instead, so it is another staple food, to eat a cube 10min before any other food so it doesn't mix with the poisons, and even by itself every 15min!. With this AV claims some of his patients healed of very toxic conditions (heavy metal poisoning all over their body and organs) in a fraction of time.",18,594
816,"So what separates Primal from Carnivore?. Raw?. And finally, bacteria is tantamount..

There is a chapter on it on the Recipe book Getting fat on raw primal is super helpful and advocated for If you can gain muscle without an excess of fat you have to be healthy Think if anything you are toxic if you gain fat very easily.. Muscle weight is a different story Most people are overweight in the west.. And most people are very toxic The strongest have no problems gaining weight because they are able to get the food In nature the strongest have no problem gaining weight and the weakest have problems gaining it so they will less likely to survive If you are toxic it's hard to gain weight No the opposite",10,290

865,"At the Hospital with my father for a Cardiac catheterizationAny thoughts?. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhrSX2UNChg Sorry to hear that.. Sending him my hopes and prayers.. My humble thoughts on cardiovascular problems is that we miss out on and overlook vitamin K2 in a modern diet.K2 is important for the transportation of calcium in the body and has shown to help both relieve cardiovascular complications and at the same time strengthen the bones.K1 is a different, more common form that is utilized in the body for coagulation.Though I have read some studies on K2 I am still not so knowledgeable on the best food sources or if there are any good supplements.. The food source I know and use is cod liver oil since it has other fat soluble vitamins like D3 that work in synergy with K2 You guys are amazing with dropping knowledge and helping each other.. Peace on you all unless we are eating human meat 😛 Are u erako Eraqi Forgot to bring a fork so I’ll eat by hand haha This is my lunch guys 😎 I agree on the K2.. There are also several other things that seem to help with the cardiovascular system.. Glycine for example.. https://draxe.com/glycine/ Too late I already ate this..

Lol Unripe fruit contains more enzymes and less sugar than ripe fruit.. For example, pineapple and papaya are good for digestion Ahhh gotcha.. Thanks Well, this is how I look at it.. Lol Ior Bock's saga is based on Finnish, Swedish (Norwegian, Danish), and English language..

The microbiom unnaturally adapts to eating man-made plants and carbohydrates by increasing the amount of fermenting bacteria in the gut..

Paul stamets is the definitive source of information on mushrooms my grandma was eating a lot of fish and mushrooms - she did 95 y Just be careful with mushrooms and know exactly what kind you use.. According to Aajonus he got a bad poisoning and almost died cause he took a wrong one accidentally.. Yep, I've researched psychoactive shrooms and they have their own purpose.. But I'm interested in how ""normal"" shrooms can be used for ailments.. And how to prepare them.. True, most of them A good source of mushroom extracts is https://lostempireherbs.com They have Reishi, Chaga, Lion's Mane, and Cordyceps Militaris for sale.. I guess they have to be prepared like vegetables to minimize the toxicity",12,203

Several of their products have been tested by independent labs to verify if you use it correctly Mushrooms are not plants.. There is evidence to suggest that early man consumed mushrooms for a whole range of reasons.. There is also evidence to support that mushrooms have several health benefits Not that much, I believe my headache was caused by toxic bloodstream, due to getting nauseous when the peaks of intensity were high, but it fluctuated in intensity which made me guess migraine at first..

However, some studies found that men who smoke may have higher levels of free testosterone..

I'm not advocating smoking, by any means.. Research around organic, unadulterated, tobacco is interesting, though.Anabolic men has a whole page dedicated to the results of various studies, which examine the effects of tobacco on testosterone levels.https://anabolicmen.com/smoking-testosterone/ i have only ""tiroler bergkäse"" 8 month n 12 month Silvia sent me a sheep milk 2 months high unsalted cheese 👏👏👏👏 no way for me - same with e cigarettes i heard organic valley is comparable to kerry gold.. but haven't tried Time for bed my fellow gentlefolk a friend rolls his own ciggies, claims it's much better than the commercial crap.. my uncle only stopped cos doc says stop or u die.. same with my dad.. I moved to australia where i didnt know anyone who smoked to be honest i smoke sometimes but not very often - hope it disappears completey.. when i get enought fat, milk n eggs last days i did weed because my shoulder is so painful first something must happen to realise whats going on most ppl don't even realise it.. and take medicine after going to doc maybe 17y or so the problem is the toxic stuff in tabacco and the pesticides (antibiotica) most smokers i know can't quit Yeah good point Michael I eat Kerry Gold unsalted well kerry gold is not grass finished ya.. grass fed, grain finished..

Not sure whether that just means ""still poison but less poisonous"" or ""actually beneficial"".. Native Americans smoked tobacco for generations.. I smoked for a brief time a little over 15 years ago, for 3 months, then got tired of it and my girlfriend at the time (now my wife) didn't want me to smoke, so I figured ""what the hell.... I'll quit"".. Tried pipe, cigars, and cigarettes.. The pipe felt like the cleanest form to me and cigarettes the dirtiest.",8,101

He said  he had never done it but he was curious and he made one for me😁 It is, half kilo for 10 €.Anton has it now and will try it in different sitationscto see if it works I am from northern Spain Neither Frank nor AV are 100% correct.. They both have something I disagree with.So just use as many sources as possible and try what is the best for you, and that's all!. raw primal I've had to up the intake alkalizing foods since I get toxic bloodstream and/or acidic body easily..

913,How do you know you are acidic?,1,7
914,"Looks really good!. What foods are alkalizing in your opinion Kim ?. I feel extremely irritated, jittery, unable to sleep or relax, I get into hyperfocus and stressed state Fruits and berries come to mind at first and are the main ones.. There are some exceptions such as lemon and apple cider vinegar being acidic but they alkalize the body.. This has proven to be extremely true in my situation and explains it well.. I lean more towards type 1 Personally i can't agree with AV on all of his statements but l let them be.. Because I realize that he had unique point of view and deeper experience than mine.. I thinki we would never have official serious trials to be done on RP.Raw primal is strictly practical - that is how AV discovered it by occasion.. I think of this as multilayer system.. The worser your health and condition the deeper you have to go into practice overcoming fear upraised by previous brainwashing.. If you desperate enough than you would try it.. If not than you are not ready.So there some things in RP which I still would not do without greater reasons justifying them.. But I would not say NEVER.I'm also grateful to AV.. I gained a lot of wisdom from him that's helping me with my patients and with myself firstly.So Frank Tuffano is just hyping, gaining attention, playing with his ego and promoting himself as expertEven I noticed that he twisted some info from AV and I am not the best reader of AV books..

I'm fine with this and I presume it is a phase.. I only get those symptoms if I eat a large steak or two raw.. Raw milk (cream also works), raw fish, raw fats manage to keep me in a stable state and eating some alkalizing foods (like tomatoes) work to counterbalance if I start feeling irritable.. Thanks for the response guys.. I really cringed when he said raccoon fed him caviar.. They way he said and the expression on his face was awful.. I unsubscribed right away.. Ahhh I see.. the source of greed is fear Cantabria Silvia cheese😂😂😂😂 Guys what’s your take on onion ok, thanks.. Because traditionally it gets added to raw fish like herring in NL and tartare generally thats pretty cheap !. maybe i find someone who can make me some without salt.. i would take them when im stabilized but only among other things like herring .... mhhhhhh Yeah I imagine it’s kinda too toxic as food but fine as spice I have read that the natives did not swallow the smoke",16,230
917,So they just puffed on it like a cigar and let it permeate the mucous membranes in the mouth?. https://youtu.be/2l-9dY3FAMk,2,20
918,"How do you guys respond to this video ?. In my opinion the really bad experience that Frank Tufano had with the primal diet was due to his massive use of accutane which killed his gut health.. Also he admitted that he couldn't control himself and frequently ate really big amounts of honey and milk together with the other stuff like raw meat.. Of course this caused extreme indigestion, his damaged gut couldn't handle it and therefore he developed problems like sibo  and candida.. He blames the primal diet for the health problems he developed but it seems that it was just his damaged body and his wrong actions which caused a lot of problems.. And that sibo and candida were there to fix his gut I noticed Frankie misrepresents many of Aajonus' claims.. Saying he has done the diet and read the books but doesn't even know the reason vegetable juices are advocated.. ""Trichinosis is not a good thing"" -Frankie.. And here I was, eating raw wild boar organs and meat, afterwards being able to gain weight very easily and keep it on.. Seems to me it benefitted my digestion 😂 (I was skinny and unable to gain weight without becoming skinny fat before eating wild boar raw) Exactly!. He twists Aajonus' words and actions to the point where they sound ridiculous and uses it to discredit him.. He appealed to the normal people by saying for example that salt is good.. Frankie's defamation of Aajonus and his teachings is also an age-old tactic of getting attention by attacking an important person, claiming he didn't know it all, and presenting yourself as the person who to listen to.. Frankie has made his channel and products his livelyhood.. He is a businessman and he must act so.. Well said.. It's always sad to see people making things into business because then it's not about truth but about money.",17,318

I got some today and it a bit sour and acidic salt is just for making the cheese durable and that it dries fastershouldnt taste that different with and without Thx, it should be near tasteless I guess In my opinion no, it shouldn't be tasteless.. Raw foods always have bacteria in and on them which together with aging or fermentation processes define the individual taste of the food.. It sounds quite normal to me, that raw cheese tastes a bit sour or acidic since there are a lot of lactoacid bacteria in it.",7,135

Plague/pestilence is the example I bet that THE MORE BACTERIA ON FOOD THE BETTAR is way-to-go concept😂 In my opinion the human body is all about balance.. Balance of nutrients, balance of healthy and harmful bacteria and so on.. A balanced, healthy microbiom which is not fed with carbohydrates and unnatural things, won't let ""bad bacteria"" take over and cause illness.. The body has different protection mechanisms which try to maintain health not sickness.. just dehydrating haha asia is mushroom region.. cos they use lots of mushrooms in artificial meats.. 😰 JR IS sodomite..

How long were you a smoker I smoked twelve years he gonna have some good dreams and you a bit of free time 😉 just tasted my two fermented milks the tibetankefir is sour the just raw milk fermenting one is very mild Its so funny, but really people think veganism is the answer but the brainwashing never lets us think that the opposite could be the answer DRAMATIC health benefits - yeah i can feel it after 2d of very old kefir It gets real sour though plus raw hardcheese",7,268

May be, but how to fix it on primal🤔Or may this is how things must go in mine body.. Fish ones I'd say not to worry about it unless you have intestinal discomfort that accompanies it.. I've eaten wild boar testicles once (tasted like chocolate pudding) and sheep testicles on and off (alright taste, smells like sweaty crotch).. Great organ to eat.. I've always been skinny or skinny fat before primal and that has attributed to me becoming nervous and irritable in my body, along with my glands pumping hormone to ""survive"".. I was on the downward spiral since high school and now I feel I'm becoming comfortable in my own skin and healing my nerves and glands slowly Less frequent tools are good.. Means one is absorbing nutrients from the food and utilizing them well.. I presume, harder is a sign of the same thing, utilizes the nutrients from the food more.. I've had wide variety of tools in shapes, sizes, and colors.. I don't worry about them that much unless I experience intestinal discomfort.. Same.. Stools are quite a bit bulkier with plant matter in the diet as the body cannot properly process them.. There was a slight pump, but I've exhausted my adrenals so doesn't do much for me..

To investigate hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) exposure in pregnant woman, a total of 102 placentas were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with electron capture detector.. Organochlorine residues were found in 69.6% of the samples.. Lindane was detected in 24.5%, alpha-HCH in 2.9%, beta-HCH in 6.9%, p,p'-DDE in 44.1%, p,p'-DDT in 14.7% and p,p'-DDD in 10.8% of the samples.. The pattern of dispersal by these substances in Murcia is similar to that described by different authors in other countries..

Lol if I eat only fish, that’s not a big deal.. 😂 do you guys have that problem or clove Toothpaste is actually not really needed on a diet of mostly meat and fat.. If the teeth don't get in contact with carbohydrates and additionally get covered with a protective layer of fat, it's impossible to get cavities..

Wow.. Don't you get constipated?. When I drink a good amount of fermented goat milk, my 💩 gets stuck +80% of my diet has become milk.. I supplement with other primal foods.. I've endorsed my inner calf.. reacting to raw milk means you have a gut infection That’s just a guess for example candida overgrowth, which steals the nutrients and let the fungus cause more havoc in your body I've taken colostrum from Jarrow Formulas before.. Helped when I had a candida infection.. https://www.amazon.com/Jarrow-Formulas-Colostrum-Gastroinestinal-Respiratory/dp/B0013OVTT8 to this Stay away from any anti dandruff shampoo or prescribed psoriasis / seborrheic dermatitis shampoo (i’ve used it for years and it’s real shit) So if you want to get rid of your dandruff just make sure that the skin gets oily again, that’s why I use cold pressed oil.. The thing is that often people get dandruff because they have a dry scalp (often due to low humidity) found in, winter / sleeping or working a lot in airconditioned rooms or just washing your hair too often (and not moisturizing it afterwards) lol im diving....

If one decides to delve deeper: https://www.erowid.org/ For some they are beneficial.. For others deadly dangerous.. Never done, but researched thoroughly.For proper trips, always have a professional/shaman who guides the trip and protects ones body/spirit from evil intentions, shit can get real..

Some months ago I've tried fresh, raw milk from jersey cows (a2 milk) and it felt really healing.. I'll definitely make future experiments with raw milk to see for myself.. Amazing transformation..

How about butter... just curious Egg whites are entirely made out of protein and therefore don't have any fat.. That's the reason they don't really bind with the hair.. The consistensy of the whites kinda makes it pointless.. use coconut oil.. but yes it does have a desserty taste Pasteurized is fine right The coconut cream ( pasteurized tho) I had before tastes sweet.. Im not sure if it’s a good idea to leave these “carbs” in my mouth overnight.. alternative is to use sesame oil, that's what the indians use.. 😂😂😂I used coconut cream..

We should approach in the same manner today.. For me drugs are far of the real human esence, and put us far away from it.. any drug is a loan with strong and hard interests.. I dont believe in drugs.. Yeah.. We may change topic.. For instance, do you find ground beef to be drier and thus making you more thirsty and/or increase constipation?. I am comparing to a standard piece of meat which hasn't been grounded, of course.. It sounds good.But, I'm so tired of hearing nice arguments to justify different addictions.. we have a lot of capacities in our body, mind and spirit that we can use before resorting to drugs.. DRUQKS 🙂 (psychadelic ones - the rest is for idiots) some people are not ready for reality - they are scared.. they live in a human made bubble.. These substances will help you!. dont do it for fun - do it with intention!psychadelics cant make you addictive !. I have so many tools that I can still use before drugs.. those are a tool.. Like everything else which exist in this collective reality.. Each and every one of us take advantage of the tools that work for us, that make us evolve, make us a better person.. I dont want addictive tools, if they are not necessary groundbeef is really the best to digest !. I think it's not about the naturally occurring enzymes in food because that theory might be false in my opinion.. So it makes sense what is written there in the article.. I believe it's more about the fact that the raw food gets better recognised by the body and therefore the body can better produce its own enzymes to break down the food and assimilate the nutrients.. The experiences of people who tried raw animal foods tend to agree with the claim that dead food like cooked food is more difficult to digest.. Whoa guys *puts bong down*",26,355

It's interesting how they used a hemolytic and cytotoxic strain of E.. coli.. They did mention that the strain didn't interact with the vascular gut tissue, corresponding with the previous findings.. However... I'm still skeptical since there are only a handful of papers that look into this.Still an interesting read.. Here is an interesting one for #4.gut.bmj.com/content/49/1/47 Because cysticercosis and taeniasis are real and the HCl present in our stomach only aids the tapeworms to emerge out of their shells.",12,143
1024,"Can you link some papers on point #2 and #4?. Why doesn't a human get sick eating high-quality raw animal foods?. Here is my answer:1) raw, high quality animal foods don't have a lot of harmful bacteria on them - unlike the cheap quality stuff2) even if there are some harmful bacteria - the body can handle it fine -> the hydrochloric acid in the stomach and intestines gets rid of them quite efficiently3) the body adapts to this way of eating4) most ""harmful bacteria"" are already in your body.. A healthy bodies microbiom is balanced enough to not let the ""bad bacteria"" take over and cause illness.. i started sucking the eggs raw vs drinking them out the shell And that's fish.",5,123

The body has to do the gathering information process every time.. That’s exactly what I said to my mom when she was telling me about my aunt appendix removal.. I told her that fasting and raw meat and raw butter would’ve healed her.. How do I know this ?Because back in Iraq all they eat is grains and vegetable oils.. :(Changing diet would’ve helped her..

No experience yet, but that's my research from Aajonus' works.. Regular berries have already caused detoxification eaten with eggs or milk Remember you talked about vomiting after berries So according to AV any nausea/vomiting is good and stands for sign of detoxing?But what if body tries to detox from what  food we eaten before and not from long ago stored toxins I need to try this..

Based on your results, I may try it.. updated version is one moldy berry a day instead of all at once The way of molding the berries for weeks and eating a berry every day is recent information that Rom Eclair shared here.. This way of eating the berries one avoids the depressive and lethargic episode and gains all the benefits from 17 different effects and stages of molding for 17 weeks ""strain with a porous sieve"" - or maybe use a nutmilk straining bag if you know what that is hahaha Some additional information on the molded berries topic - Aajonus recommended to drink the juice of the berries, not to eat the berries.. Also he said that a sideeffect of the detoxification  with this method is lethargy which is sometimes accompanied by mild depression.. The sideeffect(s) usually appear 3-4 weeks after drinking the molded berry juice.. ""If anyone is going to drink moldy juice he or she should be prepared."" Stay safe, friends..

My husband dont folow me.. He thins im crazy also That's the dificult for me, try to avoid all carbs with them.. I can't still.. They are still growing children after all, all you can do is educate them and limit on the processed carbs.. They eat meat, and chesse.. they LOVE meat.I'm Happy because their health and size are much better than during vegetarianism.. What I mean is they still want carbs.. And my older son (7) sais as a protes I dont want your diet (based on raw meat, and without carbs) He wants cooked meat.. And ask me for pizza, pasta, lentils, sugar, etc.. Wow your son doesnt want to eat meat?. What about milk and cheese?. I think its possible to survive without meat, but you must have dairy then!. Good luck Bought some farmers eggs.. And they are bitter =\ just more work to be done xD for example, my friends are meeting up at this place tomorrow.. https://www.davesbistro.com/menu-2 I try yo limit carbs with them and I try to avoid process food.. i think is more of a mental image.. hahaha!. they might commit you if you tell them you are doing raw meats 😛 Now, with meat they hace more posibilities to grow healthy.. I feel guilty did not offer meet regularly to my children before going primal, and afraid of the consequences in their bodies... I have an idea.. Don’t force them to follow the diet but instead do this You and your husband full the proper diet and tell your kids that’s one of(fake) close friend has died because of whatever because he wasn’t paying attention to his diet.. Also tell them that if you see me and your dad eating carbs laugh at us or anything else that makes them aware of what’s happening Soon they will change their mind if they see their parents are strict on this diet.. Also eliminating everything from the house could help too.. My children have seen me tring different diets very different from what people around us eat.. raw vegan, muculess, vegetarian ....",50,697
1069,"now primal.So now I'm afraid to put a lot of restrictions on food with them.They think I'm crazy,  people around me of course think that.. Fantastic!!!.

So cannot be taken seriously 😆 On the kind of fruit, the source of the fruit 1 information at a time Im a new parent but i dont believe in limiting things very much.. For example: if we r only eating meat and fruits, it would be a lot to impose further restrictions such as amount of fruit or meat to eat the pork platter looks delish!. except the carbs sending to my friends.. they will like this !",7,160

This involves going into a dark room, and shining a bright light underneath the large end of the egg.. Yes.. This one includes a fertile egg.. Difficult to get..

1176,Bozon Hyggs- what type of effects for you?. U can't spell milk without Kim D.. Milkman,3,16
1177,"37?. some places claims 48?. found this.... The most important reasons are to me that heating your food above 115 degrees F (45 Celsius):*Kills enzymes.. Enzymes help you digest your food.. Your body can create enzymes but that process takes a lot of energy.. This process makes you feel tired and heavy after a cooked food meal.. Further, the enzymes your body makes are not as efficient and effective as the ones that were destroyed in your food.Consequently, your food is not be broken down as well and thus harder to digest.. This also results in food starts rotting in your intestines, that parasites have more chance to surviveIt is further believed that your body has a limited amount of enzymes that it can produce.. If the supply is finished, body organs will function less and less.. It will accelerate aging.*Changes the pH of the food and makes food acidic.. We like to eat alkaline foods.. Eating acidifying food makes your body a welcome feeding ground for disease.* Converts easy to absorb minerals into inorganic - hard to absorb - minerals.. INorganic minerals such as calcium are hard to absorb and might cause calcium stones, whereas organic ones are easier to digest, make you alkaline, help you get rid of too many acids* Destroys most vitamins* Destroys the life force.. Eating cooked food is eating dead food.. This will make you feel heavy and tired.. Live food has live energy.. It will give you energy.. Simply put.. A raw seed will grow, a cooked seed won't.. When you pick (raw) unripe fruit it continues to ripen for weeks.. Cooked fruit starts to decay within days.These reasons are enough to explain why most people on a raw food diet feel more energetic and have a stronger immune system.. When your diet consist of more than 75% raw foods, here are just some of the improvements likely to happen to you.. • More energy • Up to 3 hours less sleep • Weight loss • More beautiful skin • Clarity of mind and better memory • Improved immune system • Improved fertility • Prevent or even reverse diabetes ok i see it now, no higher than our body temperature.. 😄",25,368

That alone explains why raw is more digestible.. lol mma-fighters ;D those ""fighters"" are pussies !. n ofc raw egg is better !. Hi!.

I think so.. :D 👏👏👏💪 Yeah, the gut flora seems like new knowledge which has created a new awareness for probiotics and even ""prebiotics"".. Prebiotics being fiber which the bacteria ferment and feed on.. Sounds counterproductive for somebody trying to heal intestinal permeability and a lot of these prebiotic foods are also found on the FODMAP list which can lead to dysbiosis.. I'm wondering weather the importance of microbiome is overblown and downplays importance of high acidity.. Organic pastures is shitty anyway imo Nope I can't find Raw cream where I live I use to make sour cream with pasteurized cream and whey or yogurth.. i mix it and put it 24 hours at room temperature.. the taste and texture is good for me, and its better than pasteurized cream, but its not the lovely RAW sour cream.",11,179

1198,"If I mix pasteurized cream with raw cream for few days can I get raw cream...?. Lol I know, but I can easily consume 2 bottles a day that's the sad part.. Has everyone ever tried to mix raw cream with pasteurized cream Foto de Antón Leitón Last year Foto de Antón Leitón Chug the snails Erik Last time I tried to eat cooked at a restaurant and on a holiday I got so sick that I'm done trying to eat cooked socially I'm fine with myself and the way I eat, it's easy to stick to.. I have to explain with a couple words to my friends, but they'll get it Yea lol I guess some people can eat the fruit with their portable “raw fat” 👍most of my friends get it too 😮 I did It when vegan Me too.. If i feel bloated, i drink a little urine The issue is that normally at social events they offer plain meat, no fat around.. So I always miss my 100g of butter next to the steak and the digestion is worse because of lack of fat I take a little piece if raw cheese with me in a clases jar Good option.. Tomorrow there will be another celebration day here in Italy.. It is common to do barbecue, so I guess I will bring some raw butter in a small jar 😅 You will enjoy the celebration I would love to be so strict to myself... but things just happen and I even have to eat the cooked meat with soy sauce and vegetable oil( I usually dip them in clean water before I eat) I can eat cooked meat just fine during social events.. And I am 100% raw primal normally.. I guess it depends on the quality of the cooked meat i.e.. either fast or be prepared for a bout of puking i make do, can't be overly strict How can you deal with social life if you don’t eat cooked food anymore So you mixed the pasteurized cream with raw cream and had no issue with it?. Last time I heard anything of trying to mix raw and pasteurized dairy was that they did it and it ended up messing with their stomach hard detox!!!. 😛 Maybe some problems that I can't still understand.. The think is I cant find Raw cream where I live and I LOVE sour cream ando fat, so I try in this way.. Haha I’ll try it out then.. At worst would just be vomit and detox like Michael said.. Vomit is the best detox for Aajonussecond best is diarrhea Where you from now that's a problem.. looks like you have to make the ultimate sacrifice.. Malaysia.. Haha yea last time I ate raw bacon with pasteurized heavy cream and vomit for the whole night If it’s really detoxing.. How can I have no issues with cooked meat.. Like I never vomit... raw cheese, the 1st one put me in the toilet for 2 days, the second one, no issue.. Cooked meat stores its toxins into fat tissue If the cooked meat is heavily toxic, antibiotic, metallic, etc.. It can trigger detox eating toxin don't trigger a detox.. Now that my body knows raw, it doesn't let me go cooked haha The body is used to what it eats and utilizes it the best way.. That's why people don't puke from cooked What triggers a detox which likely mean you have cleaned up your system.. which is good.. Gratz I puke from cooked meat now lol and we won't be having cooked food for generations otherwise everyone will be puking IMO i don't think cooked meat triggers a detox I leave it open air when I think I don't hit my finger with things.... Keep us posted, it looks like they might just do the trick Raw cream or urine, or other high bacteria stuff would help seal it quickly Sour milk cream Thanks.. M.. I have it open air now..

What do you think?. Link I am a little bit concerned Ver ""Spartans What is your Profession (HD)"" en YouTubehttps://youtu.be/aNa3Co83_gk Not me.. Typical mainstream information on virus, bacteria, parasites, and fungi Just bullshit conventional wisdom It feels more natural that the body lets parasites and bacteria to take hold when it needs them, each time I've gotten sick on primal I've become much better than before afterwards..

1225,"Guys, sorry to interrupt but is this chart real ?",1,10
1226,"Sun screen ?. What?. +1 On sad Diet civilizated humans, yesIn primal  predators, no way Tom Barnett9 horasON PARASITES AND CANDIDA/MOULDI'll share what I've found with fungal and parasite infections from a lot of experience with myself and others.A lot of what I learned initially came from Paul Chek.. Don't think I've recommended him on here before but he's been the bulk of my formal education in health, body, mind etc.. Have a read of How to Eat Move and be Healthy for a start.I came to my own conclusions about fungus and parasites before i found AV's work which is why I resonated with his books.. I found them to be janitors as he describes rather than invaders but I've found there to be some context in that.Paul puts people on fungus and parasite protocols.. While I don't agree with that entirely (in context), his knowledge of how and why they have the effects they do in people is second to none.. He's treated people who have visible parasites crawling under the skin and in people's eyeballs which can render them blind, as well as helping evacuate a 12 inch sclerous worm from a woman's vagina.Anyway, I've found that fungus and parasites are there for 2 reasons:underlying chemical toxicity not due to lifestyleunderlying toxicity as by-product of lifestyle choices.The first is due to reasons outside of your control such as amalgam fillings, vaccines and other medical practices and general chemical exposure.The second is the residues caused by processed food diets, poor hormonal control, sleep wake cycles, unnatural living practices etc.In the first case the diet if followed 100% should take care of the deep toxicity by itself.. For chronic conditions I still recommend chelators using the Andy Cutler protocol if mercury and other heavy metals are a definitive cause.. Using anti infection agents is not recommended.For those who have a weakened body due to lifestyle (the reason you have fungus and parasites) there are different options available.. The diet itself should strengthen the body, leaving no purpose for infections.. This is why just nuking them with medicines only leads to reinfection if the body hasn't been strengthened.. You also need to make sure all the basics are in place such as regular tonifying movement, proper sleep wake, natural light exposure, pooing properly and regularly, having a dream and purpose in life and using those to keep the mind in check, as every infectious organism has an energetic equivalent, ie parasites correlate to parasitic behaviour as well as victim mentalities, mercury is attracted to emotions such as resentment etc.A bad lifestyle will outweigh a good diet in my experience, so the best diet in the world still won't keep infections at bay if you're disregarding nature's laws.If you have very debilitating symptoms, I usually suggest a short course of anti parasitic/fungal remedies in low doses while at the same time upping the foods that strengthen the body and relieve toxic byproducts or 'die off.'  Baths and saunas also help with this.. Keep in mind that heavy medicine such as oregano oil can kill off beneficial gut bacteria.Any protocol taken to reduce infection load needs to take into account the life cycle of the organism in question.. Parasites usually need a 10 day on, 5 day off cycle (or vice versa for different species) repeated 3 to 5 times to take care of eggs etc.. Fungus is similar but can act on monthly cycles.I usually don't recommend killing things unless you're in a really bad state.. Usually cleaning up the diet and lifestyle has the best effect, but if you're about to go blind or can't function/work and therefore eat etc I recommend low doses of oregano oil, black walnut, wormwood, golden seal etc in addition to foods such as papaya seeds, chilis, onion, garlic, ginger etc.Hope that helps.. haha, such a bullshit from him but i still need a diagnosis",18,650

1229,"What did Aajonus thought about MMS?. Ver ""Andreas Kalcker: More information you may not know about MMS"" en YouTubehttps://youtu.be/RbTYBgwmzXY Sodium chlorite and an acidic substance mixed together = MMS Sodium chlorite is used in bleaches and disinfectants Helps to eliminate heavy metals, but also fungus, virus, parasites... Im a milkman, now regenerating Aajonus also came across that when virus, bacteria, parasites, or fungi were killed.. It leaved scarring inside the body (the cleaning process was not finished).. The body lets all those ""bad guys"" to come to clean itself up for better health.. Fungi from moldy berries is already able to extract heavy metals.. Certain plants like cilantro attracts heavy metals too.. We have all the tools in nature to heal ourselves without the need to use processed chemicals to put inside our bodies.. I know.. But i think that my body is eliminating too much.. And my kids are omnivorous.. I want to read information and I have to try everything by myself 🙈 Do baths to halt detoxification, or even eat a baked or boiled chicken..

Lol Im just ina great mood I understand your point of view and in general I agree.. Nevertheless, Frank may also be right  regarding un-natural bacteria/parasites, that centuries ago just didn't exist and hence our bodies have not learn how to handle them.. well just say that if it's not refrigerated, you definitely know it is fresh (1-2 day old) and not a week old or more..

Always seems to happen, even last time I was at the butcher.. “So this cut you’re gonna want to cook no more than medium...” I nodded yes and ate it raw in my car hehe with meats at least can say rare or blue rare.. I’ll tell her I do egg tartare Yea I have told a couple as well once I got to know them a bit better.. One guy is super cool about it, acts like it’s the most normal thing in the world to eat that stuff raw.. Sometimes gives me free organs that they will have trouble selling.. Good guy tell her you want very fresh eggs to make mayonnaise..

Because meat is very nutritious and when you are having excessive healthy weight body doesn't need it in same quantities.. Just my thoughts🤔 I recently reseached this.. Aajonus was heavily against quick and fast detoxes such as flushes.. You lose your gut flora by doing a flush, it is better to add to the flora by eating high meat or even high meat enema or poop enema, than flush it away, lose your ability to digest food, and try to rebuild.In addition, eating plenty of raw fat on raw primal the body releases gallstones and liverstones..

1341,"Detox means liquid poo?. Aajonus is not The Truth so it is advisable to read also from other sources and consume whatever make you feel great.. For instance, I recently read a book about a guy who dedicated his life to fermentation: he traveled around the world to find out the local fermented dishes and he found out that people tend to ferment almost everything.Basically, fermentation is necessary with certain kind of food like legumes and grains, I may also say it is great for veggies and in that book he also spoke about meat and fish fermentation (although not in depth).. I read books, but do not remember info about fermenting veggies and berries and is it beneficial or not (although before pd I fermented a lot) So Maria, in my opinion if you are able to combine PD with some fermented food of your culture or your findings, then why not?. 😊 Drank yesterday 1l raw milk with 3 oz cream But the detox of fresh raw milk could be interesting Everything is safer and better after fermentation I think they must be treated as a remedy..

So adaption was easier I think.. Plus I function better without the veggies carbs.. No more pain with pooping As most milk sources here in Singapore are heavily pasteurized 😬 so I seldom take milk..

Since I just drink coffee and the very rare chocolate treats But after adding cheese for the past week, I don’t have the need to floss yet I seem to only floss more on one side due to this way of eating, too much calcium oxalates building up until it hardens apparently Tight teeth, but i pulled one so im getting more room now I floss too",13,220

Envy ☹️ Ive been eating honeycomb and chewing on the wax leaves me feeling freshh I realize when I add cheese, I don’t have to floss as often Yeah but i think for people who eat grains brushong or flossing might actually be necessary Cooked both beneficial and toxic parts store into tissue The funny thing was when the earlier adaptation of carnivore, the dumping was more on the left side, now that I’m adjusted and seasoned, it dumps on the right side 😂 I just looked at it briefly, it sounds like he is more or recommending a SAD.. Fair enough, I only looked at it quickly and saw he generally recommends a high carb low fat approach, hence my comment So I think I need to add some cheese once in a while Steak tartar Eating raw the body identifies and uses what it can, and passes the toxic remains in the bowels Bone broth is not primal",3,169

People do it even when raise animals for themselves (on a country side) Mmh I get it The bones I have are from a wild pig and they are not that small, although not huge as the ones of a cow Also the pan used makes a huge difference.. Metal may leach onto the broth So what is the difference between the ancestral bone broth and the contemporary one?. Apart from the water",9,137
1352,"Soft and small bones like chickens or rabbits can be eaten easily raw.. Have you considered that instead of bone broth?. I believe that we can eat from nose-to-tail too.. But currently we are at a state where we can't live like our ancestors.. The pollution and toxins floating around are too much for our bodies to bear.. I probably will do the same, need to read more Ray Peat articles.. Thyroid and mitochondria are my main concern Maria and Kim, I decided to experiment with bone broth because every part of the animal can be adoperated for nutrition.. Some of our foods are fermented, some raw, and some cooked like the bone broth!. I believe in this way of thinking, even if normally I am 100% raw That's why only bones from wild animals would suffice or eating the bones raw from small ruminants 👍👍👍",9,146
1353,"1h should be enoughJuiced or smoothie?. Thanks!I am thinking about it only for protein purpose to help mitochondria.. From Ray Peat site:The amino acids cysteine and tryptophan, released in large quantities during stress, have antimetabolic (thyroid-suppressing) and, eventually, toxic effects.. Hypothyroidism itself increases the catabolic turnover of protein, even though general metabolism is slowed.Other amino acids act as nerve-modifiers (“transmitters”), causing, for example, excitation or inhibition.Some of these amino acids, such as glycine, have a very broad range of cell-protective actions.Their physical properties, rather than their use for production of energy or other metabolic function, are responsible for their important cytoprotective actions.Gelatin (the cooked form of collagen) makes up about 50% of the protein in an animal, but a much smaller percentage in the more active tissues, such as brain, muscle, and liver.. 35% of the amino acids in gelatin are glycine, 11% alanine, and 21% proline and hydroxyproline.In the industrialized societies, the consumption of gelatin has decreased, relative to the foods that contain an inappropriately high proportion of the antimetabolic amino acids, especially tryptophan and cysteine.The degenerative and inflammatory diseases can often be corrected by the use of gelatin-rich foods.. If you are fully raw it's not worth it.. Only if partially raw or fully cooked Views raw meat as superfood, etc.. Seems interesting, yet to research his viewpoints.. I've heard him focus on thyroid health I am thinking about adding back bone broth.... What do you think re Ray Peat ?. Especially collagen topic?. http://raypeat.com/articles/articles/gelatin.shtml Bad boy😱 I would do all day in a slow cooker.. There's really no limit it's kind of up to you.. I've heard of people cooking it till the bones start to disintegrate 😂 I eat raw bone marrow.. My butchers give It to me for free As I understood high sugar in ray pear diet is for 1) increase metabolism to help thyroid; 2) sugar somehow replace/ compete with PUFA in our bodyI came to him because of significant reduce of density of my hair and speed of growth since I do low carb.I have a feeling that only healthy people can do low carb/ keto without consequences Surely I against refined sugar but add more fruits and honey and have stopped fearing of carbs :) Also read different researches (pointed out by “gaining strength”  on fb and Instagram - don matesz ) re fruits and its role in nutrition and health .. For me it makes sense.. Considering that we have a strong taste for sweets.Ray peat explains all his food advices scientifically in details.. I have just started to read his website.Aajanous explanations are more like common sense and easy to understand -.- as  much as I like to think that our CPF is able to cover it, i still think is ridiculous that we have to pay so much haha that too.. except countries with compulsary insurance.. >< 😮 interesting.... don't get hospitalised, the jabs and food will kill you..

I had eggs and cheese earlier tho :) I Agree with the point of if meditation or any other tools is used to distract us, calm down, avoid our thoughts and feelings, think only of beautiful things, in many cases it is oppressive and attentive to our intelligence I do not like this video.. I am not going to start giving arguments for or against meditation, although I find it useful for some things.Maybe meditation cannot revaluate the traumatic information of our brain and lead us to the authentic healing of our mind, if during it there is no relief or emotional discharge (crying, laughing, yawning and trembling), which are the most important mechanisms to recover from the damage, and bring us the real reemergence of the human being.Although stopping in a meditation or stopping in our lifes may bring us a lot of fear, anxiety, etc.. simply because when we stop and put a little attention on our mind this is going to work many times on what is unresolved and what is difficult for us.""I get to understand in the video that the human being has no capacity to heal from trauma, that the design of the mind is perfect (in this I agree) and that we cannot try to manipulate something that God already makes perfect, like is telling in the Bible, so the best thing is not to move the information associated with trauma because the brain already has the capacity to ""forget"".""I do not agree with this interpretation that this man makes of the bible.. for me  mind and brain are wonderful, and yes, so perfect, that we could say that only God (if we are believers) can design something like that.. it has a great capacity to recover, to be flexible, to think, to offer us unique and smart solutions for everything that happens to us in our lifes, when we allow the mechanisms that our mind has to be healing and we have the necessary support.. (feeding correctly helps a lot in this process)We are born with the healing mechanism of our mind.. This mechanism is oppressed since we are babies in most civilized societies.Maybe this mechanism is not understood either by the New Age, or by religions, or by psychiatrists, or by those who run the system, or simply there are many interests that this mecaninsm doesnt work, to perpetuate this system, so that we all remain victims and oppressors, some of others and together perpetuating this system that has very little to do with the essence of the human being.. So I do not like this video, simply focused on criticizing the New Age.. It is surprising me how some people basically can eat all kind of crap all day long feel great How can they tolerate this toxic stuff that making me lethargic..

Normally prosciutto is just dried and uncooked, but I'm always sceptical with supermarket products.. Yes, unfortunately no one guarantees that prosciutto crudo is actually raw Ingredients: pork, sea salt but in very moderate quantity because it is ""red meat"" Prosciutto in Italy is consumed by everyone, (of course not the vegans) yes because it is dried aged meat with salt and sometimes preservatives in it.. Similar concept to Salami Thanks, this one definitely looked more raw.. ""Fed a vegetarian diet"" Soy?. Corn?. Inflammatory foods Here in Italy there is: Prosciutto Crudo (raw) and Prosciutto Cotto (cooked)..

But in my mind It makes no sence separate cream, if then im going to drink the result withough fat.it Makes sence only few times for feeling god in my mouth (sour cream) 😂😂😂, but not usually, because I have no acces to extra cream 😔😔😔Just my way.. I've noticed for myself, that pushing through detox while eating only raw (milkshakes, whatever I can stomach) usually leads to best results health wise Fall and spring are notorious for heavier detox's.. If the weather and conditions are right, the body will have a harsh detox Lymph baths regulate detox, they clean out the lymphs and connective tissue of toxins that are dumped there, if the body gets clogged, detox follows Let it separate to cottage cheese and whey, or use in lymph bath",13,211

Now 36,9 k...the only fat she accepts is milkshake but she hates milk and makes her nauseous.. Medical treatment  has made it more difficult in question of tastes..

There my thoughts😅 Thank you so much Kim",11,158

But raw fats would help soothe your itchiness I had pasteurized cream with green tea from Starbucks today.... does anyone know how to detox from the pasteurized and homogenized cream.. I feel really itchy around my mouth.😭 This is to counteract the toxicity of municipal water and also to arrest the toxins into the water Thank you so much Kim and Silvia!. 500-750ml raw milk..

Looking at iridology videos and then they propose cutting out dairy, adding lots of water, rice, quinoa, leafy greens, vegetables.... Complete opposite of what we're doing 😂 I wanna see the reaction of the iridology lady when I go there in 5 months They should be here, they can be seen emerging there This is 3.5 weeks ago This now I guess if the eyes truly change color to blue (in my instance)..

They said that a squirrel could go around the country jumping threes Good night I just had mild migraine the whole day until I took a bath today.. Yes.. Hope you can actually name raw without surprises Great photo Now impossible @tchret 3 small dots have appeared on top side of my iris after starting to take lymph baths regularly.. I go back and forth on the whole carb thing, I’m still trying to figure it out.. I used to be near zero carb on the cooked carnivore diet, it definitely helped my body composition (leaner).. Now I’ve reintroduced more carbs, mostly in the form of raw honey and fruits (still low/moderate carbs, I’ll never go back to eating hundreds of grams of carbs daily).. I don’t know what the right answer is, and it might be different for different people (there’s this theory that people of northern European decent do better with low/zero carb, whereas people from closer to the equator can eat more carbs).. So I don’t know, but purely for weight loss eating less fruits and milk will probably help.. hmmm interesting For me, it’s raw no-carb > raw w/some plants >>>>> cooked carnivore I do well enough with some fruits but I do notice a slight improvement without them.. Will probably drop them for winter like I did last year Beef Órgans, beef fat, Eggs, cheese, cream",16,280

I’ve quit 3-4 times and it never takes more than 5 days or a week for me to forget it even exists..

I guess my attempt to ease my way into this diet by alternating cooked and raw food has officially ended.. No going back now, my body demands raw it seems.. No Plus I’m eating too much ground beef these days, I’m feeling like my teeth are degenerating😂 I love feeling alive and vitally🌞 today I feel It.. Which seems not a good idea to drink 10 after I eat Just checked the PH value of Gerolsteiner, 5.9-6... What I mean is “if I really want to drink water, I’ll feel so bad if I can’t .... is this the one I can drink with my raw meat.” I always trying hard control my thirst Lol after eating food Yea Is this the one I can drink with raw meat... 😂 I eat that often Yeah, it feels nice and refreshing to take a break from red meat from time to time Nice, my eyes need a boost, they get red and tired from the long days staring at a computer screen.. Had the whole egg for breakfast today, dropped it all in a cup and mixed it gently with a fork.. It was good, the white doesn’t really have much taste and it just softens the taste of the yolk a bit, it felt much more filling than eating 2 or 3 yolks as I sometimes do.. well dont forget gathering when in season Quite a limited diet compared to our ancestors who hunted and GATHERED (not only cranberries) Yuri tries to form an ancestral diet of only meat with some cranberries as supplementary Lol Agree 100%.. The consumption of dairy products and eggs (even raw I assume) are really controversial that I have to keep finding evidences to convince myself Lol 10min well milk is supposed to grow baby cow",15,354
1435,"Do you eat raw meat?. The only problem is that water dissolves the stomach acid that you need to digest meat She is great!. I love her about the PKD type of eating without too much carbs Her videos are great I learnt it from Asra Conlu I’ll look that up!!. My egg drink tastes super bad tbh Haha yes..... Is so refreshing Is that a type of raw food... lol But they work Sometimes I don't like the taste so much..... Either Also..... Cold Whey helps me a lot with thirst I just quit eggs for hormone reasons.. Plus I really don’t like the taste of raw eggs When I eat beef I drink to help swallow Egg whites and yolk I drink egg to help my need ofvwater I know.. I already regret 😹i assume vegans can’t eat raw meat due to low stomach acid.... (my stomach acid was just like a herbivore after drinking that water...) that’s sounds very scary Yea... raw ground beef and raw salmon today.. But the salmon was smoked that’s why I was thirty but not the whites.. When I was into the cooked carnivore/zero-carb thing there were people advocating an ultra limited “beef, salt, water” diet.. Pork and chicken had too many omega 3s, eggs and dairy were inflammatory etc....there was always something.. it was kind of an extreme elimination diet.. It might work for some people.. I was never able to stick to it for any extended period of time, and I didn’t think it was necessary for me personally.. I’m just reading peoples opinion, not really doing researches myself lol I guess throw half would be great... egg whites are unnaturally huge compared to the past .. Not nearly enough anti-nutrient in the white to make a difference, unless you are eating tons of egg white w/out yolk Yes there is avidin in the white, yes avidin binds to biotin.. But there is way more biotin in the yolk than can be bound up That egg white thing is bullshit what i read about eggs, the yolk can be eaten raw I’ve been throwing away the white and just eating raw egg yolks.. The whites just don’t really appeal to me.. Maybe I should give the whites a try.. Want to get some oysters maybe Let me know if seafood helps, I crave cooked sometimes too.. I’d say prob once or twice a month the urge comes on pretty strong to eat some cooked meat Right.. Even I drink all the meat juice from the ground beef package🤷🏻‍♀️ Why... Will egg whites help, it tastes like salty water I’ll get some raw cream instead.. lol maybe some seafood What if I crave cooked meat sometimes... should I add salt to my raw meat Then it’s all good Lol!!. I drink less when I mix cream with tea Lol maybe that works for you too, dilute the cream... Ok, thanks.. makes sense Duck eggs have an amazing ratio of yolk/white, so much more yolk i vaguely remember once reading somewhere that raw egg whites had certain anti nutrients, and since i prefer the yolk anyway I just figured i’d just do yolks only, but I’ll try, I know Aajonus loved egg whites any thoughts on quail eggs?. more $$ tho due to the size Here’s one about sparkling water being doing duck eggs instead of chicken nowadays no joke i agree on the hormones part I think so... cooking doesn’t destroy hormones",35,581

Then whey comies out freely Or when I change to other container and milk breaks Ah ok, so I should put it in the fridge before the whey appears Because this pic is very similar to what I used to obtain After fermentation is, good to put in fridge ,tastes so good.. I never tried Aajonus idea of putting honey before fermentation Or... Some people just do not tolerate dairy.. I read plenty of negative cases online about raw dairy Delicious If you ferment long time the way forms on the bottom and tastes acidic I agree with Ring Could be a sign to keep raw and throw them away😜 Provides minerals, insulin-like substance that helps the pancreas, aids digestion Have not checked my odour.....

You can leave the fermented cream layer that is  formed on the top.. That is like smetana .. I put it away to add it in milkshakes as I can't find raw cream here..

They use to put olive oil on the surface to cure it or submerge it in olive oil olive oil just sometimes, and must explain in the ingredients..

Awesome you got a bison thymus!. And raw unsalted cheese 30min prior and after should help Thanks, will go slow The thymus I’ve had doesn’t have much taste.. Creamy though Finally out..

Yep Are these all chicken eggs😍 I thought it was cheese and honey mixed with fish that made me gain Así it takes an hour to drink it.. Milkshake I try to take all Nights if I have time milkshake!!!!. From 38,2 to 38,5!. Haha.. This morning my weight rises more.. Around 10 clams and cheese and honey.. Not much of cheese and honey really.. I felt hungry at night and had a milkshake.. I didn't expect to gain as I hadn't eaten 200 gr of meat and eggs like I usually do.. But I gained!",12,116

I can certainly have a couple of raw eggs before bed 👍 Hey primal police, is non-gmo whiskey primal?. Hope so coz this my second cup.. 😂 I mean it is Friday night.... Class A misdemeanor going on here I see 🕵🏻‍♂️ You're given a notice to gulp down couple raw eggs after the night to prevent ""lazy liver"".... We'll let it slip this time, consider this a warning 🕵🏻‍♂️🕵🏻‍♀️ Jokes aside, I’m not much of a drinker, but I do enjoy a glass of whiskey here and there, it’s one of those very non-primal habits I still have, kinda like drinking coffee.. I eat with my hands too Sometimes there are extra bacteria in my father's chicken eggs 🙈😂 Your friend could start with raw eggs, cheese and butter Yesterday I went shopping too long and had my second milkshake late.... I even took a nap while drinking.. I ended at 21!.. I couldn't eat dinner... I felt so lazy.... My body did not want to get up🤷‍♀.. So I stayed in bed.... And at 23 I felt I needs to eat again.. So I had meat just the, size of my fist with two eggs and some skimmed kefir..... I ate a piece of cheese before sleep and today I gained 100 gr!I am  38,6 kg.. Is nice to know that without eating 400 grmeat I can still gain.. Maybe a first step for me could be buy milk, make cheese and sell It.. Sounds great!. Milkshake is the way to go!. Yeah, the politics have really attacked small farms and put them out of business in EU Congratulations Silvia G In my case I think I gain weight even if I don't eat 🙈🙈🙈.. For the moment I decide not to weigh me and just trust my process.. 😂😂😂 Yeah Not bad idea😁 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 I had the same problem at first.. I think Kim’s answer is spot on.. Other than manning up, a couple of practical things that helped me at first were: using a strong tasting sauce, for example, you can make a delicious sauce by mixing olive oil and anchovies.. Also: eating with my hands, I can’t fully explain this, but there’s something about the more primal connection you get with your food by eating with you bare hands that made raw meat easier to eat.. Everyone should eat with their hands.. I’ve heard once that touching the food with our hands will help our bodies to send signals of hunger and satiety.. I’ve been eating with my hands since I was born.. That’s how my parents taught me.. Also I was doing the sauce tasting thing but by eating Guacamole.. Red onion Cilantro And avocados.. Helped a lot Indeed interesting times we live in.. Just gotta look back and study history and never repeat it.. Lunch today: heart meat, thymus, raw blue cheese and a cup of juice from the high meat jar.",37,522

1555,"Did you get headache after eating it ?. Nope.. No headache.. So true, well said.. Many domino pieces are set in place.. Small push within the next few years may trigger a chain reaction.What interesting and exciting times we live in!. In Spain in the villages until a few years ago almost everyone had animals.. but politics eliminated small farms.. Now very few people have animals.I want to have animals.. Good go step by step, without hurry and without pause.Just seeing me and my children improvements, encourages me to continue taking steps.. wish the muslim countries realise the restricting sale of pork to non muslims only increases prices of other meats LOL Not me hey guys I’ve got questions I have a friend trying to switch to primal diet.. Whenever he eat raw meat he choke on it and if swallow body want to vomiting.. Why is that?. I told him you need to man up and EAT IT LOL Right right Possible reasons, may be one or most likely multiple of these:1.. It's mental2.. The throat and lower jaw are underdeveloped, your friend needs to correct their tongue posture by mewing and swallowing correctly with the tongue pressing to the top of the mouth.. This creates space for the throat3.. Cut smaller pieces4.. Relaxing the muscles in face and neck5.. Raw meat is a powerful detoxifier and pulls toxins, thus vomit may ensue and is beneficial Yes, I told him about pressing the top of the mouth with your tongue when swallowing because me too at first I didn’t know how to swallow big pieces of meat.. Thanks for the reply and I’ll send it to him.. Damn.. Most people need to be educated on how to swallow and eat at an early age.. Having illnesses due to poor nutrition as a child teaches bad habits such as mouth breathing.. Also, malnutrition causes limited overall growth and vaccines cause retardation of jaw growth Native people didn't have issues with swallowing.. Aajonus explained how Inuits were capable of eating ""huge"" chunks of meat due to their optimal facial development.. The problem is we as “society” so far behind and disconnect from our natural way that it’ll take years and years to get back on track.. Especially if you just open your mouth and talk about living off grid and have cattle they would call your crazy and stupid.. Yes I got that too at the start Haha, crazy to people deep in the system but a beacon of light to those who try to escape and run to the hills!. There's starting to be a physical divide in the development of the children between transhumanist people and countryside people.. Crazy to see.. I'm getting chickens next spring!. Possibly bees too.. Bro it’s unreal.. I’m so frustrated because my family is trapped in the system.. I’ve been telling my family that in few years America will experience mini ice age and we need to start learning how to grow food.. They think I’m crazy I’ve been telling my dad to build a chicken nest and have healthy eggs His answer “No, we have a cat and he doesn’t like chickens”I was like I’m done here and I’ll be out soon.. LOL Hahaha!. Great, but a sad story too, thanks for sharing.. I’m moving back to Iraq 2021 Gonna live off grid and create a family and encourage people to do so What we have to do is take care of ourselves and immediate families first, that will inspire others.. Once our cup is full it will overflow and you can spread your ""overflowing"" wealth, love, and prosperity to others too.. It's looking grim as meat prices might start rising or even skyrocketing next year due to pork shortage driving beef, chicken, and other meat prices up.. Agree.. Now with the pork shortage it’ll be crazy sky high soon and especially we got the globalists pushing vegans agenda and who knows maybe we gonna face tax on meats and dairy I sometimes wonder if all primal live in one land and do things in our ways",44,684

Gatis thinks garlic kills everything it touches and is basically toxic.. Maybe he is on to something, but it might also help some people for the same reasons.. Either way, no more garlic for me..

Medicinal Years ago I damaged my body by eating raw garlic almost every day 1-2 cloves a day, after that I havent eaten any raw or cooked garlic/onions, I cant stand them well i do eat them, the garlic not the insects 😁 garlic keeps insects away too If you do gardening its good to plant garlic to grow close to some plants, so it will keep rabbits and moles away from eating your plants From my memory, it helps blood pressure headaches, also antibiotic",2,87

I drink banana, smoothy now😅 If you are thirsty, drink raw milk ir whey.Doesnt matter to loose a little fat I wonder if the meat had started to rotten and it made my body detox too much.. Or if the meat was in bad state and body didn't want it inside Hi!. Yesterday I ate for dinner meat that had been all day out of fridge and I had bought it on Thursday.. It didn't smell bad.. Just a little strange and I could eat like usual with egg.. Funny that I couldn't eat much.. So I suspected that my body wasn't liking it.. I stopped eating.. Later I had stomach ache and in the toilet i poo and vomited a lot.. Had a piece of cheese and went to sleep.. Then at 3:00 my stomach started to talk and had more diarrhea with cold sweat.. I was one hour in the toilet and I also had to vomit.. Cold sweat all the time.. I had cheese and went to bed.. In morning at8:00 I had a little more diarrhea.. I lost lots of fluid.. I was wondering if just cheese and eggs help to soothe or I should drink something.. I thought of fresh whey but I don't want to loose more fat.. So I am trying to make banana egg smoothie.. I could eat cheese.... 😅 We probably look sick for them Yes, I seem to get a bad upset tummy now every time I eat it.. I won't be touching garlic again, I suspect it has too strong an antibiotic effect to be eaten regularly Thus, plants may have some compounds that help to improve health, such as veggie juice So even plants stop detox",30,356

One question: I have a choice between jersey milk and A2 jersey milk (A2 is slightly more expensive).. What’s the best (most primal) option?. I never really paid any attention to this acidity stuff, but I was also cooked carnivore (with yogurt and cheese) for almost a year and at one point I started to massively crave lettuce, like my wife would eat a salad and I would just stare at it wanting to devour it.. Eventually I ate some and then wanted more and more of it, some nights I felt I could eat endless amounts of it.. I never really understood why but now I’m thinking perhaps acidity had something to do with it.. Now that I eat more raw meat the salad cravings are almost completely gone.. I still eat some a couple of times week coz I enjoy it, I just try to have it away from raw food so I don’t reduce stomach acidity too much.. 😂Lol okay I’m going back to a balanced meal with veggies.. Maybe the less green the better.. Lettuce better than spinach.. Or sauerkrate haha 😂😂😂 Were you angry at 18?. 😂 Cooked food makes people crave fruit too Eating some non-inflammatory fiber or salad (green leafs lol) that brings the acidity down with cooked could help What do y’all think😭 Gradually I feel like cooked carnivore diet has a lot problems.. Meat especially beef is an acidic food when cooked(neutral when eating raw I assume) ... and it probably cause an acidic physical environment where cancer can thrive...😭 I’m a carnivore and I eat half raw half cooked.. So overall that’s still slightly acidic.. Vince knows his shit He was recommending eating raw brains and liver Dude the jaw changed drastically when you switched diet Wow Example that raw primal is they way!!. Vince Gironda 👍",19,333

Non of the animals are 100% carnivore, not to mention we are meat based omnivores haha Yes..

Aajonus was ahead of his time lol https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6565829/ Is better to sip milk and eat raw unsalted cheese in between.. Milk hydrates if you don't gulp.. Cheese and milk good for cleaning toxins.. You look great Wider Kim yes Haha yeah, for sure A2 is not worse than the other Yeah, I tried reading about it and only got more confused lol.. I’ll probably go with A2, simply because I read that pure bred African cattle produces only A2, and if it’s good enough for the Maasai it’s good enough for me 😄 Try both and see if you notice the difference..

1579,"What's wrong with cow milk?. There are steps to introducing raw milk to your diet.. 1.. Letting it ferment for a day or two so it becomes sour milk.. The bacteria in it have predigested it for you2.. Warming the milk.. Letting the milk warm up in room temperature (if it has been chilled or in the refrigerator) for 6-12 hours so it's not cold.. Cold milk is harder to digest.3.. Obtaining fresh warm raw milk.. No chilling process is done to the milk.. Straight from the udder pretty much.4.. Drinking A2 milk from a heritage breed.. Also the cows having their horns in place and not sawed off affects the quality of the milk.5.. Drinking from a single cow.. The milk from a single cow is easier for our body to recognize and utilize.. Only problem is that it's expensive I've been experimenting with by goat milk lately and it tastes better yeah bcause of the processed milk UNNATURAL Pasteurized milk and raw milk are 2 different products People weren't lactose intolerant 100+ years back how come suddenly kids can't tolerate milk lactase n lactose ""Milk is full of utilizable lactose when raw."" - Aajonus Q&A book Especially raw milk we use rawmilk and no industrialstuff/processed stuff I know I can't prove it as ain't a scientist but I strongly believe that Removal of fat from milk I think it's because of skim milk if you cant tolerate milk your gut is fucked up - simple as that Ynwa be as unbearable as you can a J..

I don't think there is any primal difference (im sure we drank from both) and when I say its preferred, it seems to be the one people will ask for (usually people with dairy intolerance of some sort) I thought A1 came as we bred the cows more and more see, not sure man Eating smaller meals, like dividing 2-3 big meals into 6-8, often helps me personally to not undereat as well.. 🙏🏻 Thank you!!.

Not sure of the effect of ginger.. Eating a few pieces with food is beneficial.Cucumber relaxes the nerves.Green apple overexcites the adrenals and wouldn't be beneficial.My vegetable juice this past summer evolved into 60% celery, 20% parsley, 20% cucumber.. I consumed edible green clay with the juice to arrest the plant toxins and provide minerals.. I also put an egg into the juice.. Many times I had cheese cubes before and after.. I sometimes had cream with the juice too.. Oxalates and plant-toxins are a real deal, but most of them stay in the pulp that will be discarded.. The overall effect of the vegetable juices are beneficial and improves health.. After many years on primal diet, one can start cutting down the amount of vegetable juice 😁😝sure sure!!. I’ll wait During summer vegetable juice was a must for me, I couldn't eat red meat for months.. I needed something to alkalize my body as I felt anxious and hyperactive.. Now, when we are turning into winter I have dropped green juice due to it tasting and feeling repulsive and have been able to eat tons of red meat again, reduced white meat to minimum.. Hold your horses I'm dumping my knowledge 😂 Many people seem to benefit from celery juice.. As is the case with the followers of Medical Medium and his celery cult 😁 lol wow that’s awesome.. So can I just simply eat a lemon to alkalize my body if I’m out of time Cucumber, tomatoes, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar... there's many tools to alkalize the body if need be With juices, lemon, orange, etc., it's important to sip them and have some raw fat to avoid the crash",19,310

So simple, as if it were so easy 😜😜😜.Detoxing vegans are right on detox word, not in vegan word.. 😜😜😜 i just dont know It has nothing to do alkaline and acidic.....

Too tough for me All raw for 10 months Only the first week Sure, had to cook it.... One year ago I was eating 1kg of fruit + a big salad all days This is great information on honey and i how it was used traditionally Of course Aajonus wouldn't tell people to buy a non-organic chicken.. Haven't yet found the complete reason.. One major one could be that the chicken is completely cooked.. That way, ~60% of the white blood cells would go into the digestion, slowing down detoxification.. Meat or lamb would not be as tasty completely cooked or too hard on digestion?. If there is any raw ingredients included with the cooked meal the body would only give ~15% of its white blood cells to digestion due to raw enzymes in the meal.. Of course.. I have grass fed beef and grass fed beef fat.. I only gonna eat these this winter.. Welcome here bro and yes Everyone here eats raw foods including raw eggs too https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758027/ Aajonus had a work shop  there.. Really recommend that audio..

1626,"I have never heard of that honey before How do they make it ?. Maybe that's why my poo is soft.... I ate pineapple and ground beef No we arent, I am just in southern Finland honey licking good ya Here’s my guess.. According to “balanced acidic and alkaline” theory, If adjusting acidic body type can prevent chronic disease, then people can just drinking baking soda and they are all good😝 I think you feel better is more about vitamins, minerals and antioxidants in veggies😉normal human being presents weak alkalinity in their blood, which means animals blood also present weak alkalinity.. But according to that theory, all animal flesh are considered acidic, which means pigs are alkaline but pork is acidic.. And human body work the same way, the logic is you get sick first and your body become acidic.. 😁 Just eat them together in a bowl, no need to blend them, just scoop a bit of both with a spoon Cream+honey But overgrowth isn’t good right.. Candida sibo belong in lg intestine and not in that large amount... It is what the body is allowing, it's good.. The fungi and bacteria are there to clean up.. Received wrong signal.. Sugar craving is so bad🤣 Lol honey at this point tastes unneeded and bland for me.. No sugar cravings anymore 😂 At the start of raw primal this spring and summer I consumed lots of honey but now it has dialed down Can't eat more than a tablespoon without getting 'yuck' feeling.. Follow your (raw primal food) cravings yes.. first rule Fructose overall still have side effects on us while our liver process it to glycogen.. 😭but eating just raw meat and fat is so boring Even with green juice😂 Yes it has but for myself I've gained better health by following primal diet and done my fruits and green juices when needed.. Not by doing a raw carnivore diet which I did for ~3 months until I became too acidic and was FORCED to incorporate those alkalizing elements.. I recommend eating only dairy, honey, red meat, fat trimmings and no white meat or fish or fruits or green juices and see the overacidity for yourself 🙈🙈🙈Havent seen it Okay so my concern was actually- after taking one teaspoon of raw honey, my cheeks turned super red, which sounds like “detoxing?”😂 If we'd start eating and living like our ancestors we might be good for a while but those toxins that are still in us would hinder our performance majorly, we need to use necessary tools to reverse our degeneration I have same symptoms eating cooked meat",18,438

1634,"Not sure sorry.. Wouldn't your best bet be to go to a farmer's market on the weekend and buy it  on the spot?. I defo recommend hurdlebrooks that come to notting hill market, their milk is my favourite.. Haven't been for a while though so not sure if they'll be there this weekend.. Their cream is amazing just read some stuff - you need 10L of rawmilk to get 1L of rawcream.. process with centrifuge or a special bowl.. not that simple - a bit work.. Not simple and depend on the cows.... Holstein 👎 yeah sucks,.... even when im from Schleswig-Holstein 😉 maybe i find a market or a farmer for rawcream if im lucky.. Good...!. Candida (fungi) is there to heal us The one at the bottom.. More fat.. More cured Only a little more salt I eat a little pasteurized butter with my decaffeinated in bar meetings 😬 Try a lot of small meals a day mixing different foods in each meal That’s not raw!!!😂😂😂🤷🏻‍♀️ I’m feeling like finish the whole bottle of honey(1lb)😹wth Why wouldn’t aajonus just tell everybody to eat only meat and fat if he already knows the problem of fructose, and all kinds of carbs.. So addictive... Hmm.... He told to eat dairy, eggs, meat, and GREEN JUICE Those 4 are the cornerstones of this diet Can be a sign of body craving enzymes (or minerals), since raw honey is mostly enzymes Aajonus backed down from his one fruit a day recommendation since it incited too much detox The sugars turn into alcohol that the body uses to remove toxins Aajonus was against EMF's 🤔😉 I don’t know if I should listen to my gut🤷🏻‍♀️unless I have the right gut...idk Candida, Sibo digests deal with very large amount of carbs in the small intestine, but small intestine is designed for animal food and only small starch.. But sibo and Candida send signals to need more sugar to deal with sugar.. I have a lot of fig, Apple, Orange and grapes trees near my work.. And i have stopped eating them 🙈 Hahhah you must have watched Ray's new ig post Im* need to gain weight and its fukking tasty As we see on the nature of goats, cow milk is better for healing, promoting rest and recovery..

So cheese for example So long as it's raw you can eat as much as you want It's supposed to be very similar to human milk Cheese will give you constipation if not taken with raw fat There's some minute details Hmmm interesting This is not something to worry about, but I remember from the Primal FB group a person told of someone getting a consultation after a year and they had more scarring than before What about butter?. I can get kerrygold type butter but I'm really sure it's not raw Does anyone have any experience with butter here Yes, making my own Animal fat trimmings work as well I'm going to pick some up on my next butcher run",3,130

I can’t get it from anywhere :( Raw meat eaten without plenty of fat can leave you internally scarred as the meat pulls toxins..

Like I assume this is what would give people the deception that something they are doing might not be so good when it infact is Egg every 30-60min Yeah pasteurized gives me some issues for sure It can be deceiving at first.. After observing for a while one starts to see the progression or degeneration in their health to draw conclusions Not sure what to do with this frozen colostrum, I hate wasting but if feels pointless drinking it now.. I guess I should have it anyway, could still be nutritious.. Yeah, give it a try, it still should be somewhat nutritious.. Even pancakes made from unfrozen colostrum used to be very good when I tried them at the start of raw primal Ok, thanks Kim.. I wrote to the farm to try to clarify, but I guess colostrum is probably an items they can’t offer fresh all the time (baby calfs have to be fed after all!) so they probably freeze whatever small portion they can secure.. What’s everyone’s thoughts on pasteurised, un-homogenised?.

It can’t be worse than eating bread etc After all the trouble I went through to find raw milk and dairy, the farmer completely messed up my first order, the milk was missing, and the colostrum was frozen (not sure why, could be that it was left outside in the cold to long, unless they actually tried to sell me something frozen), so a massive let down.. At least I did get a decent portion of raw cream and some unsalted raw cheese though.. Well don't fuck it because then you'll but I wasn't planning to",5,125

Yeah it works, I know people feeding my cousins farms frozen cow colostrum to their lamb calfs, lamb calfs need 2x dose of colostrum I’m pretty sure we need salt right now.. Noticing many animals will lick rocks to supplement salt.. And we have more efficient sweat glands than any other animals.. Other option would be eating more seafood and seaweed, drinking blood for iodine.. I’ll eat salted raw cheese then Lol i think its BS - bcause in rawmilk (for example) you can find carbs and fats....

Yeah, I have the same question.. Usually I eat honey with butter or cheese, but a spoon at max Which one🤣 Raw eggs are a really interesting food.. I had at least 6 sometimes 12 raw eggs almost every day for 5 months and noticed big improvements.. People were talking about avidin so I stopped the whites for a bit..

Thank you!. Frozen colostrum is dead food, so much nutrients lost in freezing:( or eggs as you said keep us updated - i still have litres of frozen colostrum.... mixing it up with other stuff like raw honey could be a good thing.. Can be good to add for traditional diet but definetely not for primal diet, too bad I needed to freeze deer fat Thanks brother.. It thawed overnight and now has this deep gold colour, I don’t feel like throwing it out..

He does a good job of reminding us to take action at the end of his videos though.. Hahahaha Let it be squirrels or rats we domesticate but we need meat :D Some places have already started rising.. We should see massive rises next year when all these events hit the shelves That was Aajonus' plan, he told he wouldn't go back to cooked diet.. He'd rather die.. He said he would have those provision for few weeks or months and then he'd have a squirrel farm running (he pointed to squirrels that were near him during workshop) 😂 Preserving some meat, nuts, honey, cheese and after couple months we should be having animal husbandry, hunting, and fishing running full speed This season I recommend people to make dairy products and preserve meat raw primal style The thing is I don’t have access to dairy I need to make my own dairy If I don’t find people here I’m thinking to move back to Iraq and hopefully to start something there..

They said their product never gets to the point of actually tasting like alcohol, so I don’t think it’s really like mead.. They said if you take raw honey and drop a spoon of hot water in it (add warmth and moisture) and let it sit, it will ferment.. This seem less than ideal to me coz you do have to expose your honey to some heat, but they said no need to go beyond 85 degrees Fahrenheit.. I’m still kinda curious about this, I might call again next month and see if they have any, or maybe I’ll try making it myself with a small amount of honey.. The food shortage in the upcoming years is real and I need to do something about it.. We all should do something about it Yeah no need for hot water 🙈 It’s man..

Cancer Ironic choice of word given that this is a primal group hah This is why I’ve become more sceptical of the average “call to nature” arguments (“in nature we do this or that” kinda talk)..

I don't feel like there is much difference from fresh.. Maybe a little Letting it get high It loses its “oomph” to me... dunno how else to describe it Or in well ventilated fridge it becomes like beef jerky Aajonus found out after he got animals with skin diseases due to eating frozen meat they healed 5 times slower on frozen butter instead of fresh butter He concluded 80% of nutrients in butter (and other raw foods) get lost by freezing Freeze your hand and tell me how it feels This also depends on the climate, for example in colder climates that experience winters animals have a gene expression that if they are flash frozen they're not as damaged as tropical animals from freezing I am in the same boat as Goma.. I usually buy my meat once a week Acne is good, it's a sign of detox.. If you eat raw unsalted cheese the acne goes away due to toxins pulled into the cheese in the stomach This is interesting.. I still have some acne which I wasn't able to heal yet.. I might try avoiding freezer completely.. That's the best way to test Aajonus' teachings I've gotten zits here and there in my body once raw unsalted cheese became unavailable Eskimos ate frozen fish due to the fish freezing after catching it.. They supplemented high meat though I wonder if refrigeration has the same effect, to a lesser degree Listen to your body and experiment if you want to.. Only raw frozen products for a few weeks and then back to fresh foods.. For me, matured little salted world better than fresh unsalted Besides you need temperature in the room....

Shes gonna poo all over the streets Eat them raw how lol Use my molars cool have to try once When I look at Rafaello now it makes me wanna gag Disgusting #foodpreservationLet's talk about the best practices about raw animal products preservation.. Mainly in the fridge.. I learned that ground meat stays better on a simple plate, uncovered, like a little mountain 😁 if I put it in a glass jar and close the lid, it tends to mold in a few days.About butter, I keep it in a small container and I don't close the lid hermetically, I let it breathe.. Same with cheese.. Kefir stays nicely in a jar with a lid closed.Regarding slices of meat, I put them one next to the other on a large plate, then I use baking paper on top and I create another layer of meat slices, and so on.Organs like heart and liver, however, are not the easiest one to preserve, as I do not want them become high meat all the time.. As of now I have not found the best solution, I keep some in a jar laying horizontally, with no lid.Chucks of fat in a jar with lid closed.. Eggs and honey at room temperature and dark place (especially for honey) Always remember to get the cheese out of the fridge at least a few hours before consumption.. Much better taste.Share your food setup 🥩 Thanks for sharing.. The beef and fat  I eat is is vacuumed sealed and in the fridge all the time and I let it thaw room temperature before I eat it.. I used the same way for kefir and cheese and Eggs are always outside along with honey 🍯 Yeah I don't know I'm just trying to follow my primal cravings.. I have very little appetite for red meat right now, all I want is raw dairy, unheated honey, eggs and fish.. Here is my lunch by the way.. Tuna with fresh parsley and a bit of lime juice.. Same M I've been skipping raw meat past few days and eating halibut Worked well Holy fuck these melt in mouth into Raffaello's, same texture!.

The producer told me that they put salt on the crust of the cheese.. So I hope it doesn't get inside the cheese.. What do you think 🤔 Doesn't let cells get all nutrients In many audio files Aajonus mentions how rock sodium is bad.. It's highly explosive and one grain kills....

1732,Any primal suggestions please if possible?. Oh boy yums The grass fed beef fat when it’s room temperature is amazing It melts in my hand,2,25
1733,"Hey man!. Have you done any more tests?. Any updates and results on Flora testing?. Please share if you have.. I've done some testing too.. I'll share results right away My dinner.. I having grain fed beef after two months of eating only grass fed beef and boy the difference is day and night in the quality and texture and taste The yogurt is goooooood High liver I submitted it for testing like a stool sample And also I tested my own stool.. And guess what - I have same species of candida overgrown Well the candida is doing its job and is coming out.. Candida is way toooo high.. Found thissssss- they drink water😁 Question： why are you obsessed with raw chicken?. 🤣I’ve never liked it- mild, tasteless, and not as nutritious as grass fed ruminant I do find that dairy-butter, eggs, milk cream obviously effective cold-room.. But meat fat I have a doubt.. I feel better w long simmered meat fat or in broth than eating suet for example.... Suet or fat in raw meat- I def feel energy but it’s very slow to detox.. Think it’s long to digest.. When you make high meat- fat does not ferment, bacterias don’t break it down- that’s strange.",16,208
1734,"So how can it breakdown inside us?. With enzyme and bile for sure but that takes time and a lot of effort if bacterias are lacking especially.. I feel better with long simmered meat fat or in broth than eating raw beef fat.... I wonder raw animal fat maybe not as healing as I expect.. Maybe we need to cook the fat and break it down before digest it?. Especially tough fat, pork belly.. The only chewy part in a cow are sirloin, organ mean and suet.. Beef belly for example, is almost impossible for me to chew Idk fermentation is the oldest cooking tho But on prosciutto fat is soft!!. Wonder if dry aging has a diff microbe effect than wet fermenting!!🤔 Did you just have high meat😂😂 🤣🤷🏻‍♀️ I tried that how I figured out it didn’t work Soft fat maybe and I think jialin knows that better than I do and i am mostly doing carnivore.. I was into the whole cooked carnivore diet, then heard about people eating meat raw.. 😂 Never.. I even had commercial store chicken liver and duck gizzard and fermented them for 2 weeks.. Super gross.. But I still didn’t get sick Yep 😂 Lol",14,203

1737,You alright?. Btw what do you all think of kimchi Is that count as raw..chili... First time I got sick was drinking coffee after a primal meal Raw anunnaki liver would be awesome They think about annunakis They think about anisakis,3,41
1738,"Can i eat raw Fish if i bought it in market?. The guy told no, cuz it havent been frozen, your thoughts?. ahoi sold hi everyone IMO raw chicken has less chewing challenge compared to raw beef / mutton It could be interesting having different sources They could complete each other Yes raw fat with raw meat.... Fermented or raw veggie with cooked.... To digest and move the cement of cooked meat💪💪 That's normally when i get kimchi, together with a korean bbq.. Haha Yup!",6,85

Mild ketosis To downregulate candida.. Literally no improvement in stools last 3+ months After refined sugar.... brought by civilized people☹️ Ya In that study, the female Inuit are just like 62kg, male are like 74kg",6,89

I still eat cooked on many days but i incorporate raw foods (generally sashimi, more palatable and accessible) i think cooked foods are a no on this also, check the files list @soldpitch theres the Aajonus books you can read.. ""we want to live"" is an accessible book and may be read within a few hours, its more like a narrative book.. check the ""files"" section of this chat, there should be a dropbox link or a zip file in there come back at various times and excavate your food and eat yeah i wouldnt drink cod liver oil, seems way too processed to me ok its just two german ladies talking a bit about it (in german/no translation) they just talked about where the stuff comes from, how its produced and about the marketstuff.",6,371

1745,Some processed supplements seem to work but there is no guarantee of the long term consequences.. Are they just hiding or stopping the symptoms?. Temporarily disrupting hormones?. fuck.... i thought i might be a bit beneficial (even when its processed) The vitamins ain't the same vitamins as in real food It's processed thus it's properties have changed Better to eat real cod liver,5,63

I remember cod liver oil has been linked to cancer and premature death in the WAPF members I think Taleb’s point is that IQ tests are too limited to capture anything resembling real life intelligence.. They might have some value in predicting ones ability to perform some very narrow tasks, and in doing so might actually end up a measuring stupidity instead of real life intelligence.. See his post on the topic here: https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39 What do you think about raw deer Can't suggest anything at this point, because never had such situation.. Time shall tell!. The interior looks completely normal.. The spots are only from outside.. I think if it'd be something really wrong with it I'd be sick by now.. I had first bites on thursday and decent amount everyday since than and to be honest I've been feeling really good.. I might throw it away though.... Looks strange.. I suggest you dissect it into pieces and see how interior looks.. Also you can show how it looks within here.. If you feel uncomfortable about it than don't eat it.. However, AV wasn't against ingesting parasites 😏 Intuition is the first and sometimes the only form of intelligence we have.. Reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb really helped me understand this.. I don't really know.... If there is something wrong with it, than it means, that I can't trust my butcher.. And that'd be really annoying because it's kind of difficult to find pasture raised beef here.. That's so awesome.. I've been debating whether I should move to the countryside for ages.. I feel so shit due to EMF's or just the general vibe/energy in the city Damn man this liver looks weird Tbh i wouldn’t eat it lol.. I mean as long as you are fine and enjoyed itThat’s what matters.. Kidneys are same as livers from nutrient stand point.. So if you don’t like kidney just toss it away and eat more liver.. Hehe Will do 👍 Kidneys always taste a bit weird.. Experiment and keep tap on your bodily reactions.. Kim BROOOOO, remember my emf job?I quit last week.. Oh god bro.. Better sleep and better energy and happy all the times and already seeing less grey hair 👨🏽‍🦳 lol If it really were stones but surely seemed like it.... the liver tastes pretty fine in my opinion but those kidneys are kind of weird tasting maybe.. I dont know, I dont have as much experience 😀 Those spots on liver I was talking about.. And I'm not sure if it were stones I want to do it and there’s no debate But the only thing stopping me is Whether I want to do it in my home town or in USA😔 Thanks anyway🙏 I will try it Yeah fore sure.. Yes sir it’s easy It depend on the organ.. For instance if it was liver it should have the sweetness taste and makes you feel good but it’s it’s bitter then it’s not high quality.. What I usually do when I eat organs.. I take a few bites and wait few hours and see how body react to it.. If I didn’t get sick I’ll continue eating it.. But did you really find stones 🤯 Taking steps towards aligning with the lifestyle of primal diet 👍🏻 Raising animals, hunting, gathering, gardening Raise your own bro I know it’s hard but that’s just the way of life..

Having great time does not depend on the diet one is following Lol Cool, I'm in,))) Not enough cheese or cream in the world😂😂 It's ridiculous how much nutrients the body is demanding I've experienced a lot of listlessness again.. Not due to moldy food, but due to energy work I did last week.In the countryside I seem to become listless too.. Seems like the body enters into a deep lethargic state when it's cleaning up or healing and the body is in the right state to do so.. INSANE!.. Out history and wisdom all gone.. Old People knew more about the world and nature more then we do but sad that whatever they wrote on books were destroyed.. I agree man on everything you just said and glad to see other people aware of such thing.. Tell me the company please Do you all know about the kinesiologic test that anyone can do?. You lean backward or forward depending if the answer is positive or negative Because I believe that what it can do to your body is essentially calibrate your natural senses back What you’re saying about your intuition is something that I believe is very possible to be happening due to the primal diet or just the consumption of raw foods Ok so, when it comes to the primal diet I’m still taking baby steps and still trying to source things, very slowly.. But the things that I have already consumed raw and stil am consuming are honey, milk and now some cheese.. Man Hmmmm",12,261
1753,Cool.. I have question I’ve had different experience this week with exams and tests out of all the years I went to school.. I quit school 4 years ago and never had any tests.. But this week I had two test but what’s different is I had my intuition helping me to answer the question.. Do you experience the same thing?. Or anything similar ?.

I ate decent amount of them and haven't had any problems but I'm just wondering if the animal was healthy or not.. The beef should be pretty good quality pasture raised, but I haven't seen the pasture myself, only on pictures.... Anybody have some clues how to tell a healthy animal just by it's meat?. And as a consequence your intuition and these sorts of things I swear dude it’s different Maybe because I’ve grown spiritually Like literally if I forgot the answer My intuition would tell me how to find the answer.. Literally I got 100% but even tho I wasn’t sure about 9 questions but my intuition helped with finding these answers just by reading questions in a certain way However I listen to my intuition everyday and never do any sins (not listening to it) It changed my life drastically when I’ve re-connected with Nature/God/Intuition.. Intuition is our normality, we just forgot.. Amazing the stories, Kim, I am always seeking to know more about these ""not-science-proven"" facts Has to be done with true intention Also, a pal's friend has asked the nature for hunting luck and every time it has happened, an animal has entered in front of him and wanted to get shot by the hunter.. Literally arriving, waiting, and staying there in front of the sights for an easy shot.. When I started primal diet See primal diet is not just a diet It’s a life style.. You either already connected with nature/god/intuition or re-connect again.. For me I had reconnect again and I reconnected again I learned that we all have the answers and we all know what’s right and wrong just by listening to our intuition Gratitude is a very powerful practice 👍🏻 Got a 100% on that test lol Yeah I had this experience of intuition guiding, when I had 2 questions left on a test I did recently.. Answers were multiple choice B or D and everytime I put my pencil over the correct answer I got strong tingling in my head and hands Right right Alright bro good night In Finland people used to cast spells a lot with their words and intention.. Old folk were literally able to stop bleeding of a cut immediately with a few words.. Yeah sometimes it just feels like you can’t do everything by the book.. Like choosing to eat X, Y or Z food because it will trigger said desired effect.. Just eat what you feel like eating for example, even if just once haha, dunno.. LOL no bro this what just human suppose to be Hahahah Here’s how I know this.. When I reconnected again and started researching this up and it turned out to be true and people aware of it Just like food cravingsWhy your body crave certain foods ?Because it needs it Same goes with intuition It just your guid in life Never take advice from someone If you need help just sit alone Show your gratitude for whatever you have to your god /nature and ask him for answers and how to reveal it and he/she will do it I’ve done it and it works But yeah I can see what you’re saying Or just what humans were supposed to be like naturally You’re like a super human Oh my god I believe so tooI started hearing better after 15 months of no music and headphones Literally I can hear people what they whisper and talking about from feet away I’m going to bed, good night everybody Then, clicking on the hashtag here on Telegram you can see all the post with that tag I edited mine, so it includes the hashtag https://twitter.com/normonics/status/1198617647337951233 The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race",19,671

Fats also bind with toxins and escort them for extraction I read this part... but it doesn’t convince me😭... my friend was convinced by me to consume raw dairy(he’s been paleo- carnivore for 5 years), and it turned out he fainted on a bus station.. Yeah I wouldn't consume a quart or two of raw milk immediately either Fermented raw cream actually... Starting very slow and after a few months the ""allergies"" caused by raw milk vanish.. It's the raw milk detoxing pasteurized milk deposits that causes allergy symptoms in many cases After the few months one can easily down few quarts a day Here’s my finding these days.. Very likely to be wrong tho, it’s just a guess Naturally occurring foods rich in ""emulsified fats"" can cause sensitization if eaten regularly.Such as milk, egg yolk, crab roe, shrimp roe, fish roe...If you eat it every once in a while, or every few days, you won't have a problem (with the intact intestinal barrier).But if eat every day, you can develop allergic reactions.The assumption is that these foods wear out the intestinal barrier (the exact mechanism is unclear), and that each time takes a few days to repair -- usually in two or three days if you're healthy and well-nourished -- before you can eat again...I've observed similar phenomena in crayfish, hairy crabs, eggs and dairy products....",10,293

So I better skip it Wtf cinnamon, tumeric, and ginger in milk It’s Kefir, but yea That brand is all over stores in California but I think it’s bad quality So picky lol.. But I agree..

Guys what’s the difference between HDL AND LDL?. The only thing I found is both are good and but they function in a different way!Aajonus recommended a book called “Cholesterol myth” if anyone wants to get the real answer I'll do it tomorrow morning 👍🏻 in 12 hours Both are good just that the ratio is important Many health systems is still flawed.. Let’s GOOOOOO Or inox iron The body is in a cycle of rebuilding and detoxing I don’t like that brand Is this one good?... Or the symptoms went away but the toxins still are in the tissue, but not being discarded.. Weight also plays a huge role whether one notices the detox or the body even does detoxing It has become clear to me that proper ENVIRONMENT is essential to good health just as much as food.. Living/Working in a toxic environment is going to be detrimental to our health even when consuming the most “nutrient dense” foods 👍🏻 That's one of the most important things I'm still living in a city and a modern house, but I've improved vastly.. I'm looking to move to the countryside though away from EMF's and for fresh air I live in London currently.. One thing is that my body has been aching almost every day the last 3 months or so Coincidently since 5G has been released.... Yup, the cellular damage is immense.. The city is testing 5G in my city and I've already got problems with current technology The more I use technology, the more brain fog I experience as well.. We were never meant to have this level of stimulus and dopamine release I had it at start I dond believy https://youtu.be/1mX4O8iCYe0 Nobody on cooked meat tell about detox, nothing, but she eat her stakes rare One thing I notice about cooked carnivore diet is that people would have symptoms by adding other food- which I guess is more like elimination diet rather than “heal the gut” diet.. But a raw diet helps to rebuild and regenerate.. Maybe Mikhada didn’t heal herself ?. she just ate the safest food... Seems so, like slaves Realy Aajonus has load of examples and I posted them also in the comments aboveFish, chicken are less irritating than red meatCucumberTomatoesVeggie juiceAre what comes to my mind now that I've used frequently In group keto gains they eat meat but they all want to loose weight....

I was skinny fat, pale, and looked like a stick before carnivorism and primal.. underweight im skinny That's one reason why some Mediterraneans are hot headed 😂 If you are skinny or average weight don't do it, since it produces solvents aka fats are used up..

It’s fairly easy to find online or in store but you must absolutely look for honey that describes a production process where honey is protected from heat exposure..

Well I won't do worse than full on fruitarians lol I do the milk eggs and honey Apple juice high in sugar mixing it with raw fat and honey enzymes sounds safe but even tho you have it own its own and have raw meat before bedEverything will be fine next morning On one hand Aajonus wrote rarely or never to drink fruit juices.. On the other hand my irises tell me I need some alkalinization That's an option too but I'm on the edge 😁 i would give it away 😄 I was thinking of taking it with butter or putting it in milkshake of milk, eggs, and honey I have a dilemma.. I have 3 quarts (litres) container of high-quality apple juice!. It stores for around 2 weeks in the fridge after opened.. This would mean I'd consume 7 ounces (2 deciliters) of apple juice a day to get rid of it in 2 weeks.. 👍 I'm not that worried since I have a good amount of fat in me that I've kept for few months now, so actually the apple juice works as a solvent to discharge some toxins Yes sir.. I hope the quality is goodWe will see I don’t know what to do without you guys 👍🏽 suck a great community I’m excited.. I just three emails to some farmer that sell goat milk and cows milk along with yogurt and butter.. Also there’s a farmers market people sell there raw milk every Saturday I’m definitely checking it out next week There’s 3 local charters in Tennessee That website is linked to the WP foundation, not sure if it has local info for you tho.. I would just go here: https://www.westonaprice.org/category/local-chapters/  And look for a local charter..

I dont want to eat meat .. But i eat it Kim , Apple juice Will help you to disolve toxins that any other food cant doI would drink It slowly in evenings with butter..

Many difference depending of milk type.. cow's milk (jersey or not), goat's milk.for example, very difficult to curdle goat's milk, so you need gauze.Low-fat, low-protein cow's milk is also hard to curdle.. So I need to use a cloth to strain it.In the photo below, It is the last test I did a month ago of cheese in this natural way.. @xwindspirit you inspired me Why don't you eat honey Tried honey and I know it works..

LoLOL One reason for this test is Bc cat can’t produce taurine by itself.. I know I know.. Have to watch for alternative hypothesis tho 😂 Post this Bc it’s funny.. SDA stand for specific dynamic action We found cooking to decrease SDA by 12.7%, grinding to decrease SDA by 12.4%, and the combination of the two (cooking and grinding) to have an additive effect, decreasing SDA by 23.4%.. “We measured oxygen consumption rates of snakes prior to and up to 14 days following feeding and calculated SDA from the extra oxygen consumed above standard metabolic rate.” 😂😂😂 Interesting test that cooked meat digest better: assessing how the cooking and/or grinding of meat influences the energy expended on its digestion, absorption, and assimilation (i.e., specific dynamic action, SDA) using the Burmese python, Python molurus..

Protection from vaccine damage that hinders lower jaw development is common for asians of late.. I’m still biased tho.... but that’s what happening around me... i might be fat but I dont feel bad Yeah he was ill but his internal organs were not ridden with toxic chemicals, the fat on belly had absorbed most at least thats how if eel if we eat healthy good foods we have positive fat injured my lower back after losing weight.. because there is not a lot of cushioning left.. i think the big difference is what our fat is comprised of Hard to believe, most fat people are likely to develop type two diabetes or have high blood sugar Also sleeping on hard ground is easier, the cushion of love handles is comforting well, you are not wrong there.. kekekeke And that too Oh!. Any fat is good on the body.. Aajonus did iridology reading on a fat man who had smoked his skin was gross but his internal organs were very healthy she is tall 😂😅 ok There's neverver too quick..

They can't force us into slavery, and according to some sources they respect you if you take your power back and reach your true potential read a story about illuminati who ritual is was to do a red substance - many think it could be dmt from a trees bark....

1956,"Is that why he gained popularity so fast ?. I heard comments he was bogus and riding on other people of the carnivore community.. I like Paul Saladino talks.. no 😉 Once I saw a Milkjar video (Goatis friend) saying that Aajonus had a client that was the producer of one of the TV show where he appeared.. I think it was that one where there were some doctors that co-hosted with the main host that was an actor wearing hospital uniform.. Anyway, in this case in specific he appeared on the Tv due to have helped the producer.. It was that show where he ate raw chicken infront of everybody and then the doctors were disgusted and etc.. No All these ""illuminati"" symbols are our own symbols yeah, they stem from pre-christian Europe and are misused Very slim chance there's an illuminati, everything is done in the open and the plans are told to us through through media, news, tv, movies, fantasy books, fiction, sci-fi that stuff must be soooo strange.. everbody - who did it - experienced the almost the same.. like tunneling - the room/the dome/intelligence .... and so on If there would be illuminati they would look like aajonus eating raw meat, blue eyes, tall, muscular, and long hair.. yeah on the hidden land Worth a try, but not now when there's too much things on my plate already.. Maybe later in my life It's natural From frogs and some plants Yeah he mentions in his book that we evolved from monkeys to eat raw meat Pepe the peyote",13,263

Seems like you should, yeah oh scheisse",4,74
1958,"What is Germanitis ?. All things in my life I've done point towards Germany (played world of tanks as mainly germans, 4 year old visited germany got a scolding in German and eyes blew up, listening to german march songs very emotionally, learning german in high school, etc.), also I've gotten mental images of nazi imagery, and when I see SS-logo, totenkopf, german uniform, luger pistol, german ww2 helmet, when I see these I feel like I am home, and feel elevated and lots of uplifting emotions surface hast du nicht keine angst Was ist los meine Kameraden?!. Das ist untermensch muzik I never listened to this band.. can you speak more or just some phrases ?. german is a brillant language!. Just some phrases, my German is very rusty That moment when Jesse Owens was more respected by Germans and Hitler than US President lol Something like that, don’t know the details Past life regression would be “go back” to a past life, visualize it Wellcome Berry Europeans evolved from neanderthals and cro-magnons Well, I’m Sumerian and I was made by the annunaki 😂 Damn you pulled the longest stick I mean I’ve seen the Sumerian tablets and I’ve seen the people that look very to these tablets and I think I was genetically modified bwhahah I feel so conflicted reading about WW2 official narrative and alternative narratives since I had a past life there, died on eastern front ~1944",6,241

I just finished reading .. I know how you feel 😂 those moodswings can be very heavy - i had the same issue but it went away with raw honey and healing earth - also make sure you get enough fat.. And if the detox is too strong eat cooked meat.. Ok I haven’t had honey in a long time.. Yes the fat I am doing well with, I was having lots of cream that mixed well with eggs.. But beef fat doesn’t mix well with them for me.I will look at trying honey again I read carbs boost serotonin in the brain, so that would help.. But I would like to understand why eggs cause the issues.. I need to find some new sources to compare different eggs.. Raw eggs chelating with heavy metals 😂😂😂😂 It’s busy down here Yep I can go with that, just funny they didn’t do that to start with.. It may well be that I am now starting to actually detox better after many months.. But I will try to confirm this by comparing different eggs hmm i need some proof because i would feelt so faulty if i gave him hope and cant cure it https://i.imgur.com/kumjyWo.png im not sure what he means  here , means that gangrene cant stopped yeah but those are scars i guess from skating and he has gangrene Healing!. Marks almost gone.. This is the fastest yet for any bruises I had have to date As the body becomes stronger it's able to go through heavy detox's Very interesting!. I have certainly craved more fish over colder times, I saw Weston who has the channel that was called Carnivore life on YouTube say the same.Yes eggs gave me exactly the same symptoms with the added anger/rage.I have started to crave huge amounts of muscle meat also opposed to the amount of fat I craved before.. I like the idea of my body guiding me what to eat.. As I have been forcing eggs down.. Eggs are great source for building body Especially if it’s high quality.. I used not liking the white but now I love the white Quirky eggs matter Wellcome Berry!500 messages?. Are you fucking crazy?. I have 3 children😅 Some people don’t seem to be meant to eat this way in this life I think it’s probably the quality of the eggs.. I used to eat loads and now they make me sick to eat Eat cheese to clean the road first I get very angry shortly after eating raw eggs now too They are really orange so I’m assuming they are good, only issue is they are immunised Why I don’t know it is a mental state like I want to break things Lmao They used to make me very euphoric, but not anymore now just angry I am undecided if the quality has decreased or if I am detoxing I think I’ve got a lot to do Of detoxing* For me my reactions to raw foods have changed over months.. Some foods are more euphoric and others have lost their euphoric quality.. The body is guiding what foods to eat.. At one point eggs started giving me mad anxiety and diarrhea.. After couple weeks everything returned to normal with eggs but my general mood had improved Damnnn Like nearly threw up",28,643

2024,"own urine ?. I have books if you are interested A lot of people cured gangrene with fermented urine raw eggs and kefir too and to apply honey on feet thanks i suggest him to eat raw meat + honey But if he experiences symptoms of high blood glucose then I’d suggest feeding a mixture of honey and butter.. I don’t know why but fat seems to decrease the glicemic index of foods that would normally give you a big sugar spike or wathever.. And if this man with the gangrene eats some raw/unheated honey his blood circulation will improve.. I observed it trough my iris that it did it for me.. The last time that I looked at a iridology eye map the part where some people have that dark ring surrounding their eyes it shows how well their blood circulation is.. In me this dark ring was kind of thick but then after consuming some raw/unheated honey it became very thin, so I presume this.. Because some of the properties that you can commonly hear being advertised about honey is that it improves bloodflow.. In We want to live there is a section that explains on what to do if you get frostbite.. I don’t remember if there was anything on gangrene there might be some part in the book that talks about it, I don’t remember, however, doing what everybody recommended up in the chat might already do it for him.. Thanks.. I am drinking 2 days fermented milk Especially when the dry skin so easy to peel off but not itchy.. Chewing marijuana the way aajonus told him Poland ok poland and raw fish is going to be tough.. will help with the meat when i get home i can get some raw fish sometimes, like i got some halibut today i need some ideas to make it look nicer than just raw meat in a jar so I can eat it at my desk without feeling weird :D Spread lettuce over it and don't eat it Will find out this Saturday.. At least my skin will be 75% recovered in time for my cousin wedding Add pieces of tomato for cover Update for my scars!. Fading 😆👍 paypal.me/pools/c/8kreWNs9P8 you need a make up artist for the raw meat.. either with some coloured sauce so that it doesnt look raw or with spice powder so that it looks like jerky with spice powder you will need to let it sit chilled for at least 6hours so the it looks dry like jerky and not wet raw meat Great😁 Fastest recovery ever..

I can easily tell.. Like I’m bloated and full AF right now but I can still eat 100g unheated honey mixing with butter How to tell the difference I watched sv3rige video.. He’s also skeptical about green juice and so much dairy in the diet Sv3rige is a psychopath lol He doesn't understand or promote lymph baths the way they should be I don't know how sv3rige out of all people missed the importance of veggie juices He's also severely intolerant to raw milk but doesn't want to work through it by drinking small amount every day to detox the pasteurized crap Sv3rige gets his alkalizing effects from fruits he eats and juices Sv3rige is a limited and psychopathic perspective imo I trust my cravings on meat and fat, even fruits( in small portion) but not dairy... I'll repeat myself: I drank 30-40 quarts a week of raw milk in my first few months.. There was something I was really lacking that only dairy could provide.. Now the amount of dairy has gone down to 10-20 quarts That’s already very little for me.. I used to eat 3* this Dairy is also one of the best ways for body to get fat..

Google for Happy Goats.. Thanks thats what i said days ago.. .... I find hard to follow the group with so many messages.. I suggest using the group for Raw Primal.. Jokes can be fun, but I don't have that much time available.❤️ Anton is, the best, example I disagree, some here have tried vegetarian detox diets what includes some dairy and eggs and many long-term problems.. Detoxification with malnutrition is a very dangerous combination.. that's because here we have no issues with organ meats, unlike USA.. Wild game meats is almost impossible to find, as for meats, just ask for local meats, that is good enough.. Of course Cheaper than Los Angeles.. I guess it is relative.. General quality is a lot better also.. A lot of meat sits in plastic packing on store shelves too long in LA.. cheap?. compared to?. hahaha.. i found beef/lamb/mutton in accra cheaper than malaysia.. That's my plan.. A bit limited on transportation for now.. Luckily the meat options are plentiful and cheap here.. you can get raw cows milk which has been boiled but not pastuerized.. or go hunt down the farms.. RM 29 per L is steep, but I will have to try it eventually Particularly evident with the organ meats.. They stay fresh much longer here..

Anyone felt this?. You’d defo notice this not being intoxicated time going by slower I think I always thought about this.... I remember people who were 30+ all spent their 20s drinking and going to bars/clubs every weekend and they would all be like “your 20s absolutely fly by” From ages 17-21 my life went by very quickly and I use to notice how much of a blur my nights out would be... one minute I’d be in my friends having pre drinks the next at the club, the next we were outside waiting for a taxi and this repeated a few times a week for about 4 years of my life..

2393,"Why you’re dry aging ?. The purpose of the lemon is to ""prep"" the fats so they get digested rapidly and can go to further than the closest organs that ""rob"" them first So by adding more fat, the extra fats would just be digested near stomach and not get to far away places I’ve always thought way lemon but then I heard aajonus say to make people like the Taste.",2,71

We are getting our driver licences now and after we will get hunter licence.. But hunting lands are really expensive and regulated in Sweden.. You must know someone to get to Hunt basically.. My uncle is a hunter so hopefully he will help us Though he hunts up north so it will still probably be like a once a year experience to begin with until we can sort it out for ourselves around Stockholm Or just do it illegally I mean who cares about deer population anyway In some aspects maybe it is.. Kind of unrelated to laws but vegan maniacs have been burning land and houses of agriculture farmers in Sweden Hjönk hjönk as we say Clown-värld Hunting is a hot debate.. Both me and Ingrid would loose irl contacts/friends if we were openly hunting animals i dont think i would lose any contacts, maybe a few instagram followers but theyre just old classmates who i dont care for anyways 161 women 188 men in our parlament 2019 Also I don’t know what you mean slemon I don’t think gender is the entire issue, our most Conservative party leader is a woman and all the men in the parties are really weak and liberal these days.. Smiling to the cameras and virtue signalling on Twitter about everything They reflect the development of pc culture and globalisation.. Only the core parties like the old fashioned conservative socialists, Christian party and the nationalistic parties seem to stand their ground and not cater so much to their voters Actually the Christian Democrats have changed a lot for more votes.. They have a looser immigration policy than the socialists I'll visit Northern Sweden to hunt birds one year Hello beautiful fin neighbour Stockholm about what?. its common sense to be disciplined Yes..

One can express their emotions but today many are overemotional and unbalanced.. I have started to see my own emotions are heavily affected how tight my muscles or nourished my body is.. When my musculoskeletal system is aligned and body nourished I feel content, blissful, and ""in the center"", neutral..

I couldn’t answer the question What y’all think ?I think everyone thinks they are living life the right way until they know it’s not right and then change how they’re living their lives.. For me it has been the inner voice in me, my subconsciousness, my higher-self.. Some have snuffed theirs so it's only a faint squeal.. Nature will show us the way if we let it Same in my situation.. You have to be aware of the higher power and then you’ll know how to live life but the average person who’s trapped in the matrix it’s gonna be hard on him to live life correctly without the divine..

Then I would mostly focus on frequency.. Adding heat is nice and I do it in the sauna too.. Find the places you are too tight and what fascia/muscle needs to break up to fix it.. For example for me this is mostly outer side of my left ankle and my left shoulder.. Fixing shoulder is nice because I feel so much more relaxed and confident not having rounded shoulders anymore That you drink loads of milk My goal is to restore proper movement patterns back to my muscles..

Because stopping the flu stops the body cleaning itself.. — So, someone would just eat the way he normally eats?Aajonus: No, I would have them eat anywhere from four to seven smoothies a day.. So that’s anywhere from eight or nine to eighteen eggs a day.. You blend the eggs with banana, cream if you have it, honey, or just banana and egg or orange juice and egg.. [Recipe] — And the reasoning behind that for flu?Aajonus: Eggs are one of the most powerful detoxifiers.. They bind very quickly with the toxins.. As they come out, they can arrest them.. The extra cream is even better because it soothes the tissues.. The banana allows a lot of potassium to soothe the burning effect.. And also a lot of lactic acid may build up and it helps relax any irritation.. — And what about addressing the actual viral element?Aajonus: The virus is never the problem.. The virus is there to break down, to dissolve the matter.. So the virus is your friend.. And I always tell my female clients this – do not stop a cold.. It is your natural face lift.. And it’s a cheap one.. Of course it won’t last as long as if you go for a face lift.. — So the idea is that the viruses, the bacteria, the pathogenic microorganisms are flourishing because they have toxic material to feed on.Aajonus: Correct.. — So you are going to eliminate the toxic material and that will eliminate...Aajonus: Right, the exhaustion theory.. — One thing Sally’s got that comes up a lot is what we call ""heebie jeebies"", and I’ve always associated it with a calcium/magnesium deficiency where the legs become restless.. People sometimes call it ""restless leg syndrome"".. You just can’t keep your legs still.. It occurs in her even with calcium/magnesium supplements (and they help).. Are you familiar with it this?Aajonus: Yes.. After the poison mushroom I had it terribly.. It’s a severe fat deficiency in the muscle tissues.. No way to relieve the lactic acid.. By supplying the mineral salts, you are providing an absorbent medium, but it will not handle it in the long run.. In fact, it will start building up cakes of minerals in the muscle tissue, bones and joints.. — It will build up minerals?. Which is not good?Aajonus: Without fat you cannot carry anything out of the body.. — So, you are saying that it turns into deposits that can’t be removed.Aajonus: Right.. So she probably has a great deal of it stored in her legs.. — So she should basically eat raw eggs.Aajonus: No, she needs raw cream right away to soothe the tissue.. She needs to get the tissue soothed.. That’s another thing that we need to talk about.. You don’t want to go in on a client and clean them out first.. That’s not the main objective.. The main objective is to calm the body down, to soothe it as much as possible.. I’ve had a lot of clients who are also in the profession and they like to go right in and clean out the problem.. When they do it they freak out the client, because their poor body starts going through terrible stuff.. I say, get the body as relaxed as you can first, then put them through it.. And it will happen naturally anyway.. Always go toward soothing the body.So, if we know that those deposits are in her muscles, but we don’t worry about that.. That will clean out in its own time.. So you supply the cream.. The cream is the best for soothing tissue.. Butter is next best if you don’t have the cream.",50,882
2470,"If somebody can get it and make it properly — coconut cream is even better than butter.. But you have to be able to juice it in a Champion juicer.. It’s not as good as cream.. [Remedy]— So the cream has a soothing quality.. What is it in the cream that makes it that way?Aajonus: Well, when it goes into the body it is still water soluble where butter is not.. So the body can take it into places where it won’t normally go, and your body doesn’t have to deal w ith breaking the fat down into a water soluble substance.. It doesn’t have to bind it with lecithin or any other of the emulsifying compounds to get it into a cell.. It’s already emulsified.. It’s already broken down into that vehicle.. But once you make it into butter, you’ve changed it from that and the body has to.... it doesn’t have to do a lot with it, but it still has to put it through a process.. And when you are healing somebody, you want to give them stuff that is most easily utilizable and assimilable, and that way it relaxes everything..

Better cooked fat than no fat😅 Yes.. 👍🏽Avocado is my savior but still doesn’t satisfy..

I drink the whey I used to do this on fruitarian, tasted like coconut water, now I don't need to because of the nutrient density of raw primal, people who don't consume animal products in their diet often drink urine as it is a raw animal product Smart.. I eat half recipe because it is filling Last time when I double the recipe I had so much fat and lemon it That it pulled Tonxis from my joints and left knee feels fucking amazing now For starters ?Yes.. Lubrications formula (cream version)is great way to start introducing fat to the diet",4,113

My lifts in the gym kept going up.. I broke all the rules of PD and felt little to no difference.. It's all genetics tbh.. Some people have more inherited health to play around with.. Plenty of PDers look like corpses because of bad genes.. Ya 100% that's why judgy PDers are fucking annoying.. and if you plan on having kids, early twenties latest..

Plant foods were seen as survivalism, starvation foods, less suitable alternatives to animal products that one could eat as much as they wanted.. Meat was scarce.",5,117

Yeah but it was during a hazy transition period towards primal last fall I didn't salt my food too much, never been a fan of salting food They are running their bodies sub-optimally..

Саздърма Kinda don't wanna start him on this but today Im kinda in the mood for arguing I'mma do cheese pulling to pull these toxins from brain I have a lot of toxins stored in my brain too when looked into my eyes Aajonus ate rice  and butter Maybe give it a try.. “Many people need starches to bind with toxins (including excess hormones) that stress the body.. We may obtain that starch by eating a Nut Formula once or twice weekly.. Some people may need to eat a little cooked starch with plenty of raw fat if they cannot digest the Nut Formula.. That may be determined by eating the Nut Formula when we are extra-stressed.. If we become more self-controlled within 12 hours after eating the Nut Formula, we do not need to eat cooked starch.”.. https://aajonus.gitbook.io/wwtl/specifics-about-particular-foods/nut-formula Not I didnt..

Use a generous amount of salt in the tray to create a very dry environment.. shrubbery did you bring a scrubber to scrub your back bath time for primalists Take the cheese to the bath Thanks Gotta do cheesetrain on hot springs..

Nice My iridologist noticed how calm and more centered I am compared to the average Joe.. Improvement in just 3 months.. Yeah you become less neurotic when the toxins aren't fucking with your brain chemistry and signals Kimchicken👏👏 Asking for a friend Does psychopathy fades away on this diet Haha..... appears Ah yeah, but Rom wants to get the toxins out faster Bruh you've been wallowing in a hot spring for 3 days straight I'm getting worried lol dope s†uƒƒ my milk is coming tomorr It's completely unrealistic to imagine that primitive hunters would not drink milk from the utter of a lactating animal they killed.. This behavior has been observed in traditional cultures like the Khoi San in southern Africa, whose hunting practices go back farther than we'll ever know.. Imagine them being like ""naw let's just discard this milk coz it's inflammatory""?. In all likelihood humans have drank milk for as long as the have hunted mammals.. Where can I order raw butter in uk It helps being 2m and +110kg lol Say before and after that, that you appreciate their offer You say you're allergic (we become ill from cooked or processed shit now on primal) and have a strict eating regime Delicious.. I don’t blame you thats the sperm he wants .... https://youtu.be/EdYOCxYKhI4 Shit guys how do you keep raw heart in the fridge?.

2557,"Do regular people question it?. Do they know what it is?. Most likely yes, I can't remember the exact statistics and science behind it since a database on it was removed few months ago Is that due to the different racial genes or something More melanin pls Srs chat only!!!",3,50
2558,"Based on your profile pic?. germany extreme Haven't done dna test but im not 100% Bulgarian We need subtitles Osteoporosis and mental health risk rises dramatically in mixed babies who have significantly darker skin in Nordic countries due to not-adequate amount of sunlight.. That's logical Ultimate alert Ultimate view alert In my ultimate view, looking from a survival point of view, mixed race baby is less able to survive in either of the parents natural location: Since both of the parents have uniquely over time adapted to their natural environment and thrived there,  it will be increasingly more difficult for a mixed race baby to thrive, since it loses most adaptations to the natural environment other native people retain True, interracial couples are already more toxified living in a city.. That affects other aspects dramatically For example, in the case of white father and black mother the risk of having to take a C-section shoots up due to the different structure of the baby, unsuitable for black woman's uterus.. But it could also be that C-sections are being pushed more to black mothers mixing races is not the cause, but correlates and scientists have picked the correlation up in statistics statistics Waiting to eat eggs.. Still cooking You all crack me up so early this morning 🤣 Or it got lost, or the past generations felt embarrassed and decided to stop the Inheritance of knowledge A bit fucked up My ancestors were smart enough to not leave anything for the future generations Pls, interview Yeah my sarcastic persona bled over to this side So what do yall think of mixed babies",6,271

We usually only have one or two stayed at a time here but I've seen places in Europe and America where the sky is criss cross stringy cloud there moit Incredible Aajonus talks about women on Primal diet having 1 or 2 contractions and the baby is out He looks about 5 now that he's been on his natural diet, super friendly he's always keen for some pats and he's a lot more muscular He's my roomates 11 year old cat and when I moved in he was just eating dry food.. He was super skinny and a very irritable, sleepy and not so friendly fellow yeah it was a special condition - weed, tabacco alc and NONANA True, with Primal Diet making a baby is even easier than that, or atleast as easy So i watched a few home pregnancy videos and the women who had hard time giving birth and long contractions were either vegan or incorporated quite a bit non-nutrient dense foods I've seen insane results in a cat I've been feeding raw meat for 3 months This is horrifying as it is inspiring.. I've seen the changes on myself going from a boy to a viking.. Can't wait to turn into a neanderthal.. does anyone knows what kind of drugs AV did ?. (beside medical ones) And Aajonus was very sensitive himself noticing miniscule changes in his body That's why Aajonus' material serves as our holy scripture as it can be leaned on and comfort us, brining clarity to our decision-making Yeah, the long term effects show us which way our health is moving and through that we can see was the food a good or bad addition.. Sometimes it takes months, for some it takes years to see progress into either direction, degeneration or generation",10,362

This chat has been extremely helpful It’s your gut bacteria that wants it, not you Often times I've found relief and now experience only primal food cravings after teaching my body In my situation, the cravings I get may sometimes be for cooked or processed foods.. According to the cravings I will then think what primal food substitutes the properties or taste of that craving.. when i was a teenager i ate a banana and my eyes where swollen.. when i turned my eyes to the right or left the eye where snapping Ok fine I’m not here to play sematics.. U know what I mean lol Sugar *unhealthy Certain food groups are unhealth even if u crave them It’s not that easy tho.. Even if u don’t care your body does.. :< lucky Not really, the gut bacteria send signals to you body that you crave something..

It adds nothing of value.. Eat suet instead.. (Dairy lovers gonna hate, lol) Yes, thanks to my logic my cravings eventually went away..

Raw grass-fed beef nose to tail i think it’s dangerous to say ‘give in to your cravings’ and then say something like ‘sugar is not food’ most lemming out there cant even tell the difference Not when you’re unhealty, then it craves.. I’ve been carnivore for 3.5 years.. I don’t have any cravings anymore.. Only hunger Evolutionary adaptation.. What’s your point?. They eat when hungry, not when craving We should not crave anyting.. Only feel hunger Or malnutrition Experiencing craving is a sign of unhealthy gut flora I read everything 😂 Really Or with seeds oml That's a good bread She prefers chocolate and other sweets 😢 #temperatures, #storage Raw cheese with raw honey should be less ""dangerous"" to her But raw eggs start the Detox..

Lemons are vegan Like I said: dairy lovers gonna hate 😉 Filip you're exactly like one of Aajonus' followers denying raw dairy for himself for the same reasons.. Aajonus sent him an email response about it.. Exactly the same answer as slemon here provides, it's detox and health giving I’ve had in the past.. They were clogged thanks to dairy good one - i forget to search for goatmilkstuƒƒ Duuuuuuuuuuuuude no It is detox duuude 👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻 That’s why we’re here 😅 😂 Over time I think (after 10-20 years on primal), we could transition to goat milk since it is closer to humans and the mucus formation is not as intense as with cows.. Do you have some kind of sinus problems I’ve had stuffed nose all of my life.. Went away when I quit dairy.. Came back on raw dairy When u sick u have stuffed nose..

Perhaps it could only be mental, and the loss of social support interracial couples experience affects the overall well-being of the parents and children.. As earlier explained, this psychological pressure itself exercised on interracial couples, in my view is deeply rooted in our subconsciousness and comes from the fact of loosing the unique adaptations to the surrounding environment and nature, giving others who are more adjusted a noticeable advantage over those who aren't.. And that means a more difficult time surviving when harsh times return.From a primal perspective, I deeply care for my kin and descendants, and also of all folks and people, to survive and thrive in the upcoming grand solar minima's and soon to follow glacial period which has a dramatically high likelihood of happening this millenium..

Letting it ferment for a day or two so it becomes sour milk.. The bacteria in it have predigested it for you2.. Warming the milk.. Letting the milk warm up in room temperature (if it has been chilled or in the refrigerator) for 6-12 hours so it's not cold.. Cold milk is harder to digest.3.. Obtaining fresh warm raw milk.. No chilling process is done to the milk.. Straight from the udder pretty much.4.. Drinking A2 milk from a heritage breed.. Also the cows having their horns in place and not sawed off affects the quality of the milk.5.. Drinking from a single cow.. The milk from a single cow is easier for our body to recognize and utilize.. 6.. Pastured cows milk is better than grain-fed cows milk Here we go again The ultimate milk adaptation chart Kurts My belly makes noises and bloats when I consume cold milk So I drink it warm Well I got my milk chart that's scientific I have bought raw milk from multiple farms but they never sour they just go of tasting and never clabber This is a very serious chat..

2622,"@alonzoharris1 Have you read Bechamps work?. Or anyone else?. Yeah, I've read of this.. Very interesting hunting tactic Carnivore month!. They're literal cancer.. They go inside your skull.. One of the main things protecting you Maybe we primally ought to have long fingernails for catching onto pray and ripping and tearing lol I didnt notice that.. but will pay more attention for the duck whites next time.. They yolk is not orange tho :( oh?. my duck eggs have dark orange yolks thats duck eggs I got scammed by folks at farmers market.. they told me the yolk so orange but turned out to be yellow and not even close to orange.. sweeeeeeet Until I get my own chickens I'm not gonna say anything about what each color of yolk means.. Some could feed peppers etc.. to affect color, or feed them color dye in food do tchret style.. crack open egg and eat there in market I wanna see what carnivore chicken egg yolk looks like yes in japan they feed carrots to make yolk darker I feel you man.. Ive seen people feed their chicken buckweed and get super dark orange yolk I suspect the whole orange yolk obsession is a bit overblown, I think lots of factors affect the color, I’ve had great quality eggs that weren’t very orange.. Maybe coz there’s less of it, duck eggs are almost all yolk.. Love them 😄 damn.. They have tricks on all countries like paprika or corn I ate a wild birds small egg by luck last year and it was yellow.. But very creamy and fatty taste, like butter.. I usally base the quailty of eggs by the shell.. if its hard then I rock with it Have you ever had guinea fowl eggs?. The shell is like a rock my grandfather uses to feed his chickens powdered calcium tablets to get harder shells I have eggs fed in field with bugs and corn and the shell is not so hard as the organic from shop never seen their eggs even when i was in accra i dont even know what  fowel is but now I know after googling it I've thought to feed mine their egg shells (grounded into powder) back and fish scales, also bones and cartilage from time to time.. that will be great add fish guts too well if chicken is on real diet, the shells wont be soft and insects I put two duck eggs tonight too and see how it gonna taste.. I like the duck egg whites more then the chicken egg white.... dunno why Nice.. $150 to get cancer Keep yours if you can.. If they start bothering start investing the cause and if they truly push and wreck the other teeth then it may be time to pull them the only two sympoths I mantained is; dandruf on my chin and mustache and gum inflamation, the other is gone.. I began to tought that my bad lympathic circulation (due to dandruf) on my mouth is because the wisdom teet cuting the lympathic circulation, and of course modern dentist only want to do is; radyography, extract this mollars, ortodoncy, and all this expensives shit treatments!!. fuck em all interesting topic !. amen We all make mistakes.. We learn from them and then it's part of our duty to guide others to not fall in our footsteps.. That's part of our purpose here in life.. Helping and guiding others :) Well I guess human being use tools instead of nails.. Long fingernail is inconvenient in that case Hyvää uutta vuotta!. so you had to redpill me at the last hours of 2019 ?. smh Happy new year everyone.. wish you a great year ahead of you everyone and a year full of meat butter and honey.. Haha!. and used duck eggs instead Coconut butter tastes awesome and I kinda get a craving for coconut butter, honey, and butter combo.. Not sure if it's good yet since the butter is dehydrated coconut meat with fiber and bit of coconut oil natural coconut butter is made from highspeed blending coconut flesh This coconut butter I have is marketed as made in a stone grinder and not in a highspeed blending machine",41,708
2623,Includes the fiber?,1,3
2624,"speaking of butter, how do you guys melt the lub formula fast ?. I be taking forever to melt it down and then shake it any tips ?. Warm a bowl of water and put the cup in it yes thats what I do but it takes forever lol But Aajonous doesn't.... Start earlier or put butter out of fridge beforehand just made it but without honey.. good thing room temperature here is sufficient to melt butter Depends of room temperature .Here is not so hot Seems that we shouldn't eat the fiber Yeah they can have them",5,98
2625,"I'll try that.. how long butter can last outside before it ferment ?. The guy i used to buy lamb from he feed his chicken fresh lamb blood after cutting it In addition: ""after root canal the stem cell producement will be gone"" https://www.toothbank.com/top-reasons-for-gathering-stem-cells-during-wisdom-teeth-extraction.news I googled it In the FB primal group",3,52
2626,"do you have any source ?. wow I didnt knew that information I'm keeping my upper even though they are coming at a slight angle towards my cheek (outside) I've read that even they could cut our limpathic circulation on the jaws Yes, the dentist told me this; that they push your jaw, blabla.. Of course in order to sell me their treatments Wisdom teeth produce stem cells which quicken our healing.. They are huge stem cell factories My lower morals were coming like that so they took them out when I was 11-14.. Affected my lower jaw shape If gOD created something is in order to keep it, lol These wisdom tooth stem cells are very high quality I have no pain If they aren't pushing directly towards other's I'd keep them any thoughts on: wisdom tooth¿I have 2 bad molars in bad positions due to years of eating-shit.. OFC modern dentist only speak about ""tear out"" the mollar and try to selling us a farmaceutical-shit treatment nice, is there anywhere that gas good quality meat too and only hold it when I’m typing gross motor skills sit 1 metre away I just got a hands free stand for my iPhone then play stuff on speaker better than paying for be ILL Also intestines of wild game I will hunt wired earphones suck though they snag on door handles and stuff I have the two down mollars so, visible.. I had gum inflamation, I realized a conventional ""teeth cleaning"" because I had tartar specialy due to excesive paleo-plant based diet.. Now on raw, I guess i will not have so many tartar.. I'm cleaning my teeth with my urine, a raw egg and olive oil that's my cream.. I'm afraid of anestesia and post-operation i thought about this too but when I looked at how then my nails are I was like uh-ah no he has a slaughter place for animals where theres a little a stream for blood the comes from killing the animal and travles through to the end of the door and thats where the chicken at That's interesting",10,353
2627,"He puts the blood into a cup and the chickens sip it?. hennah clay.. yesss i wish my phone still working I had a video of the entire thing and them chicken be eating the clutterd blood like crazy haha I'll also ask for waste parts from butcher, I could also eat them too 😁 Pretty much what I eat my chickens will eat + they'll have some seeds, their own feed that's raw and natural",3,76
2628,"I think that makes a balanced diet for them?. Nicce.. Correct.. We are what we eat ate.. so since we both carni why not feed them butcher waste ?. btw most butcher waste good shit and they dont know about it lol Guinea fowls are great, they’re loud and feisty birds.. In some parts of the world they are still found wild walking in herds along the side of the road.. The farmer I get eggs from keeps them on her land for ticks and insect control, they are great for that apparently.. a bit small but running wild in accra I was watching this raw meat video.. Do y'all think we should grow out our fingernails",10,117
2629,"Thats aweome.. how the eggs taste like ?. They'll be my little dinosaurs Nice 👍 Kinda like animal claws resharpen themselves when they live naturally I was thinking about this two days ago when I was trimming nails.. I wondered how could use these withiut cutting them.. also am I the only the have werid finger feeling after trimming the nails ?. I kinda lose my grip too Delicious, tastier than chicken but very small.. You might find them at farmer’s markets in the US occasionally.. I'll keep my eyes for these next time I go farmers market.. It would explain why some people are getting fingernail extensions!",9,108
2630,"Lol how about color their nails🙃 animal flesh and blood in the nail?. Clay can work as a color too Literally some men's perfume are ""wood forest"" or someshit you can get by rubbing yourself to trees lol How about perfume There are natural scents like flowers or pine that can be rubbed onto oneself From the standard diet And vegan Lol No Fuck And I'm never gonna pull em out At least I'm having four new teeth coming up Will it impacts my health It is fine, it will be a memory for you Thanks aleksi Cause I lost one Will a lost tooth impact health or jaw structure Is it possible to regrow a tooth You give me Arabic vibes",2,122
2631,"lol any info whats in bonemarrow ?. Sorry Aleksi you cool.. And nice advise 👌 Go talk privately, this group is about primal diet",3,24
2632,"But you like Arabic ?. Berry is a medium 😉 Yeah, maybe it's just the picture",2,16

2634,Wbu?. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3417664/ Bulgaria 🇧🇬 hahaha i want the full list no :😘 If you add cream to milk or eat fat you won't experience lethargy Im obsessed 👍 Or clabber,2,30
2635,so you're looking for being high and dairy makes you feel angry?. Yes yes yes That's right and eggs Also That lethargy comes from the minerals in milk pulling toxins,2,30
2636,"Kurts tried highmeat ?. That's curious.. Normally dairy makes a person feel calmer and relaxed, and red meat more aware and angry Raw dairy makes me anxious.. Cream is okay... but not other raw dairy.. Like you feel calm for a while, and then the anxiety comes from no where High meat I love that shit I can eat bucks of it jeez Raw Dairy till this date is a mysterious food with so many variations in terms of quality, sourcing and the person who eats it.. I guess it doesn't fit everyone What do you use for hydration if not?. dairy What's going on here cucumber and tomatoes are not always in season.. Blood is not easy to source.. Fat itself has metabolic water but it seems not enough.... eggs might be an option Fat is enough I tried just fat and meat It work hi I am not able to send my msgs as fast 😠 And what is this new slow mode enabled???. 🤔 🤔 interesting",12,169
2637,"You lost a tooth but regrow 4 new ones ?. Ah yeah the chatty group some of you created last month, if I remember.. No time for that 😅 And that's great 💪 It's natural that this kind of group could not stick to food topics Chem trails, the earth is not round and the 1% controls everything 😁 thats it 101 Geoengineering It's weird thst hydration was never an issue eating cooked food and drinking water.... You got that Soviet Russian look whut ???. a little piece of it and im high for 24h Nor do i 😂 musclemeat beeƒ",5,101
2638,What high meat?. But I think it only works with no eggs and no dairy just my experience hm.... sounds like mdma and stuff like that - sometimes i think those bacteria byproducts are just like mdma/xtc - how is mdma produced ?. 😄 im gonna start it now bc of headache I'll soon start eating high meat again Raw high meat heals But was good time I broke my anxiety and depression I hadn't had time was drinking milk No joke last time I took high meat was 8 month ago Too much high meat feels like a mellow low does mushrooms For real guys if you take too much of that shit will kick in and be mellow and see some auras around objects and a little bit colors and that's when I new I will never go back smoking weed that absolutely makes you a degenerate,4,149
2639,How do you make it?,1,5
2640,"r u serious ?. bc this is a serious chat 😉 no honestly you saw colors ?. See colors haha Yep if you eat alot of it you trip out and thats even too strong for me 😄 Cheese or kifer is better By killing your self and nature Go vegan and love nature Veganism ftw I did it when I was vegan, for a few years, so it can be done Sure, probably it is not about hydration, it is about living without dairy Problem* Or if you have broblems with milk No need for blood if you can't get it And some high meat juice Will do wonders Beef suet and organs Trust",3,115
2641,Do you use beef steaks?. No no not muscle meat I did it with raw liver,2,16
2642,"If you don' open it in many weeks is it spoiled?. I forgot it in the village...... But each to there own I never liked it Cooked fat makes me sick 😷 You can say it's fat and meat cake , unfortunately heated :') i don't have access to raw fat, meat currently Is eating pound or 2 of mince beef ok with some honey Wtf is that girl allright im doing it.. but im gonna need some horseradish n gingerrootTHX seventh day of yellow slime and headache.. bronchial im fine but nose is blocked.. wondering what that is .... never had such a ""cold"" any thoughts what to do ?. /  beside lemon.. Raw dairy is important part of primal diet Donate Makes you weakenHe told that we need all our Blood to heal.. If we give 2l, de have to creat It and have less energy for healingMaybe It is the same with semen.. I feel dehidrated with ir without milk.. Worse when i practice sport for more than 1 hour Every raw animal food nourish and heal in a Different and complementary way I mean high meat So who here likes raw meat Where you from berry Thanks man Shit man I don't know haha Why do they produce stem cell That there is tooth coming up I can see the gums looking My wisdom teeth are coming out Brother Hello Aleksi *all tooth Wisdom tooth produce stemcells, theres never a good reason to get them out.. 😂 Remember guys don't eat high meat and drive Ok.... Be super careful when you open it again.. Air pressure.. Maybe feel good hormones Yes I tried kefir felt better but not high Nope.. He seems to miss connection to nature, to tribal living, and self-sufficiency depicting from his videos 2 years ago.. I wonder how he has advanced his thinking to this day.He shows no connecting to his ancestors, even though they are right in front of his eyes it is 😬😅 just asking to be sure tried to donate blood for the first time, they cannot find my veins.. wasted my time waiting.. lol the staff even have the audacity to tell me to exercise more while sizing me up.. lol 😂 and I was carrying alot of stuff that day.. Lol Asian has that problem in common.. My mom says the same when I go back home Usually ladies don't need to donate.. They have monthly blood loss already.. You can check your ferritin, if it is below 100 I don't think you need to donate Your level is pretty good!. ya, i am due for a follow up.... just don't have the leave to do so.. donating blood .... wtƒ Primal person's blood transfusion could make someone high haha!. Aajonus told to not donate Blood unless It is a familiar or someome very near you Wasnt IT like 2 months for Blood to mature in your spine You know what!. I quite drinking milk I ate just raw meat with honey before bed and woke up 2 hours earlier fuck yes and, without the noises in my belly and cramps.. Feeling high.. Usually I slept 10 hours or more When drinking milk Or dairy Life's changed Without dairy and eggs Dairy makes you sleep more, it is healing Fuck it, I love my energy back I need 8-10hr sleep with dairy, without it I do 6-8hr Was drinking and eating for 8 months Same shit Every day But before dairy I was still doing primal just meat and honey and fat that's it felt the same high and energetic I like 6 hours so I can do alot of shit Haha But started with 8 today so good Even gatis Don't drink milk Just occasionally Not really🤣 I’ve read 50-70 is a good level 😮",33,639
2643,right?. that is low,2,4
2644,Dont know why you are using these words?. Stay serious Agreed yummy@ Is it safe to just eat moldy berries like this Or has to eat with fat Or maybe it’s not moldy enough,2,34
2645,What're y'all thoughts on skin checks?. Not sure if it's done much in colder climates but do you think it's legit?. When doctors check skin for melanomas n shit Bullshit But for example Australia is a unique case of its own since many white people moved there and have gotten serious melanomas.. Haven't researched further if it's caused by sunscreens and toxins or that the Brits etc.. who migrated there are overdosing and burning their skin because their bodies are used to Western European weather and not Australian.. Yeah I'm a very fair skinned dude and the sun where I am (in the desert but soon moving to the coast) is absolutely brutal It's to hot go outside from like 11am till 4pm,6,123
2646,"how are the fires?. I'm better of with blood hope is getting better I donate blood every three months to keep my ferritin levels as low as possible.. Even that it stills around 260 and it is pretty high based on my understanding.. I'm trying to lower it down to around 80 In fact, when we were hunting in the wild we should get hurt very frequently and be bleeding quite often.. So it has sense to me to do artificial ""bleeding"" by donating blood and reduce iron levels.. Rafael, you make a good point",6,95
2647,"How do you feel after making your donation, immediately afterwards and then a few days later period?. How is exercise?. Cognitive thinking?",3,22
2648,@xwindspirit what books you recommend in iridiology?,1,7
2649,"Worth eating??. sure, except the packaging.. had to take a double look.. woodlands dr ...... 🤣🤣🤣 for a moment i thought was a singapore product victoria, australia don't even grow coconuts.",5,31
2650,"would blood donation apply to females as well?. or not recommended?. they cannot find my veins without giving me some sort of chemicals (they said) i don’t think we need.. My ferritin level is only 64 on a carnivore diet...haha Haha good point..!. ☹️ you drank fresh milk?. Because I felt that, too.. I quitted drinking litres of fresh milk.. Now I drink a cup of kefir and eat cheese.. No eggs.. I don't feel the lethargy of those milky days For hydration.. And my mood is shit I even get angry when on dairy what a relief .8 fucking months in hell Raw meat heals That's true cause when I started raw primal I only started with raw meat and raw fat and I don't need hydration I only did it for 2 months then I started bringing raw mill Milk I guess I'm not fully healed Better live that milk for the calf hahaha Maybe go back in 1 year No milk will probably miss but I need to feel high again Hahah And enjoy life with family I'll only have access to raw goats milk for another 2 months so I'm going ham while I have access Dunno when I'll have such an opportunity arise again Yes drink I'll is the most addicting food there is Milk* It is from nature, perhaps our body wants it on a deep level Well every one is different, at this stage of your life maybe you don't need it, and that's fine, you may want some later on in life and that's fine to Just be open to change (: Any specific reason?. As far as I know I found one scientific article with relationship between donating blood and reducing chance of heart attack by 80% good slave I'm assuming donating blood would put the body under unneeded stress because it has to produce more, yes we would have lost blood in battle but would warriors wouldn't have.. The goal is to keep our blood in our body :3 You can elaborate your point a bit more Do you know where your blood is going once they take it?. Something to think about",14,363
2651,"WHY giving your lifeforce to others - who is responsible for his own body ?. One thing is where the blood goes.. Another thing is if it is healthy to do it and why alone the fact that you push a needle into your body .... such da dumb thing Nature would suggest it's not optimal Well, it sounds kind of  philosophical.. I'm open to listen other people's point of view but I'm expecting something more elaborate your blood is holy stuff - imagine the german tribes back in the days hitting needles 😄 Serious chat here only Dissolving toxins and bringing minerals in Our sick bodies also need more fluids Or maybe I'm just so used to drinking fluid that my concept of hydration is distorted Metabolic hydration And high meat And some honey But nooo dairy ain't gonna look at it no more Thank you for sharing🤣 I really need somebody to tell me how to quit dairy Gatis is not someone to look upto.. He doesn't use all primal principles, completely disregards them and his mindset in life is broken.. You are missing out on a great deal of healing by turning your back on dairy products Honestly idk how to do primal without dairy.. But same issue.. I sleep 16h a day with dairy I'm Latvian aswell we all have that mindset hahahah Yes that a big issue It's hard for me to quit dairy aswell but living in hell for 8 months is not good I’ll have to cut milk and honey.. I can drink this for 8h and sleep for another 16h I've lived in dairy hell for a year.. It gets easier over time, and every time I don't have dairy available for some periods I see how far I've progressed due to dairy.. Then I consume more and return to the pits.. Maybe he does it for entertainment 😂 There is a saying In Latvian don't listen what a Latvian says look at what he does Just cause of fucking dairy and eggs It really popular in Latvia among the ancient ones And he leeches off of others instead of building self-sustainable lifestyle that primal goes along with.. He is not primal.. Thats true.. But I respect gatis for giving me the red pill I started primal cause of him I respect him for that too.. He was one who brought raw meat to my life.. But we shouldn't cling to teachers when it's our time to advance Perhaps you're still learning from him and my words don't call upon you yet But the milk thing is real , I love milk but it's too much for me to live in hell and suffering I feel high and my attitude towards others is different when I don't use dairy I always go in to anger easy with my parents But when I did without it like 8 months ago I was grounded And now it's gonna be the same I struggle with hydration without dairy Same man I'll have to eat fat But no the new generation The same day I feel a little bit sleepy but easy to handle.. The next two or three days I feel almost normal and in less than one week I can't appreciate anything different from before donation.. I didn't feel anything related to cognitive.. I feel a bit less energetic related to exercise but in a week or so my energy gets normal I tried that, also.. But I guess psychologically we want some liquid Nhaa the mind is easy to program Yeah I'm pretty happy right now I'll be able to manage recently Kim 🇫🇮 had it the same time as me while your brain detoxes in... some time, can't say for how long either you will get them some more Used to get occasional suicidal thoughts aswell which sucked yeah same Turn it into something positive I seem less autistic now too",23,659

Guys.. very serious subject.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToHIra5dndw Oh, severe depression, obsessive thoughts ergot is primal enough you will need psychological help tho If I could manage it all before, I think I'll be able to again People who go through heightened anx/depression levels can only truly understand what you’re going through I've never been to a therapist or anything And payed good money too I went to see plenty Without having experienced said thing themselves* Listening to someone relaying a book to you is retarded But gut health was also a huge role in my mental health You can’t get help from people who haven’t been through what you’re going through you will have to manage psychologically, because it's a physical detox I just had someone explain to me that it's not their fault that they're like this, in my case my dad and stepdad.. They likely dealt with the same thing, and if you don't forgive them, you become them.. I went to see therapists who didn’t even know what dp/dr was and then the next time I’d see them they would tell me how to “recover” from it I had quite the opposite experience",6,202

I could lay down just trying to get to sleep with no distractions for hours and still not succeed.. And that meat was the answer Hot teas always irritated my skin and made it hard to sleep That’s when I knew that I’d been lied to etc It wasn’t until I started going more meat based that I had a day of peace Practiced everything, meditation, taking herbal teas to relax, yoga the fucking lot 🤣 I still had heightened anxiety lvls I need this I couldn’t leave my bedroom at all Brandon Back to normal Yaaah me too Destroying the systeeem Finally",5,186

2679,"So only need of pineapple mixture to be hydrated?. Heaven In my temple Now I’m telling my friend about me using urine to heal my wounds and he mentioned that there is a small community in Taiwan that practices drinking own urine for better health 🤔 Tell me more I agree.. Our mind has its own mechanisms to heal.Of course, nurturing and cleaning our brain helps a lot.but to heal our mind we need more tools than a diet.My great tool is Emotional Management Just requires some psychology.. It would if you could get the oppressor to realise what they're doing and understand what happened in their life that made them that way.. Good idea if it would work 👆 Good we can do it in southern europe between june until first october on sand beach I believe that people who oppress other people need a lot of support to recover their physical and mental health.So maybe supporting people even when they are malfunctioning is a great solution to make this world work better.I do not agree to oppress the oppressor, (for example in this case remove someone from the group) because in the long term I do not see a solution for a better life.A solution, could be set limits, and support to encourage the release of old traumas that make us to have misbehavior.. Yes, that place calls me to visit and relaxes me Not..

In contrast to A2 milk, the chain of amino acids in A1 milk is broken down to form the OPIATE (!) beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM7)..

First of all, it has a potential effect on the opioid receptors of the digestive tract and the neurological as well as the immune system.It can slow down digestion and cause constipation.It has also been shown to have negative effects on the development of newborns and infants and in some children BCM7 has been shown to be a risk factor for apnea (respiratory arrest).In addition, there is convincing epidemiological evidence of an association between BCM7 and the occurrence of coronary heart disease and type 1 diabetes.Release of BCM7 from A1 beta caseinHowever, most of these results are not yet sufficiently reliable and further investigations are needed..

Why would it kill you ?😂 But yeah, I do know pork/chicken are somewhat more dangerous....

I still today feel sad thinking of that lamb.. 3 lambs were killed cause it was a big big barbecue we were organising.... you get them on the ground, sit on them and cut their throats.. 2 lambs had their throats cut by the ""pro"" and were just left bleeding out on the ground once they lost their strength......

Super thin as well, absolutely no cream.I have seen people kinda get enamored with the idea that California is a good place for raw primal, and I just don’t see it that way at all I was under that notion of a glamorous Raw Primal Lifestyle in California as well haha.. Everyone that I talked to that traveled there always said LA was incredible for living this way.. And of course with Aajonus living out there a majority of his life I thought it might be the right choice to relocate there to make improvements for my health.. Good to get info from a native like you tho, you saved me a potential headache Well to be fair I don’t live near LA.. I have heard the dairy was better back then, but the Organic Pastures dairy now that is in a bunch of stores is not any good.. And it’s the brand almost everyone buys The meat may be decent, but it’s expensive as all fuck Nice.. Very interesting.. I've been to France, not to visit.... just drove through the country heading from Germany to Spain.. $15/gallon for shitty milk with no cream (and I mean zero) in a plastic jug I’ll pass I bet it is expensive.. They love to price gouge anything labeled organic/ healthy.. Especially in the promise land and bigger cities.Luckily the farmers I go to practice organic farming, but they dont labeled it as organic so I get it at the cost of the grain fed cornivore garbage lol $10/Lb for mediocre grass-fed meat 15 fuck that, I get mine for 5 and even that's expensive compared to other countries Yea dude it’s real bad here, I don’t get the hype And if you’re living in the bay or LA, and you don’t have a comfy job you’re gonna be scraping by as-is Oh really the in store dairy is trash.. Hmm, well that actually doesnt suprise me too much..

I can understand the organic fruits and veggies, but for me the meat quality, while decent, isn’t superb.. And it’s extremely expensive Cali just has a lot more variety than other states.... it is also alot more knowledge on organic foods and so to say more 'woke' when it comes to healthier lifestyle practices.. So you have more opportunity to get your hands on quality grass fed animal products.. To me it's unbelievable that out in LA you can just walk into a grocery store and buy raw milk, cream, butter, etc.. That is so illegal where I'm at haha.. They raid private raw milk farms and amish farms alot for doing under the table word of mouth business.. They are strict on having all the farmers play by the state rules.. i guess i’m the lucky one, my wife eats raw meats with me.. 😁 but she prefers minced less work chewing I understand now thank you I need some raw cheese, only raw dairy legal here Still difficult to find Also my fiancee:) Julianne",16,235

I'm jealous I'll have to experiment My gf also doesn't eat whites raw, she does eat them in general but she cooks them and mix with ground beef.We tried experimenting whipping the whites without cooking them and the texture definitely changes.. they just have to be eaten with something, not by themselves.. So you might try that I'll try these, my problem is more the texture than taste thanks 👌 I slip the White with a straw and then drink the yolkOr drink It from the Shell Aajonus Style I used to, now I eat both like AV said to do.. If you mix the yolks with the whites it tastes fine",10,212
2874,"I had diarrhoea earlier today....... could it be drinking lots of beer Saturday night?. I guess so.. How do we handle things such as beer other than not drinking beer..

I read it's better to eat whole but don't like the whites 👆🏻 I mixed it today and it was much better but still not as good as only yolk, guess I just have to get used to it I've lost complete taste in alcohol.. Especially after drinking raw german beer and having diarrhea and high fever for couple days just from drinking a pint.. Kinda makes me find friends who like to go hunting, fishing, outdoors rather than to the pubs on weekends.. Alcohol is such a radical neurotoxin and on Primal diet it acts as a solvent for the toxins inside us, usually forcing a heavy detox yeah but alcohol is alcohol.... going out with friends and drinking water kinds of sucks.. Especially if in a country where can't even smoke some ""toxic"" green flowers freely 😉 Yeah I get you, here in Finland drinking is especially big part of the culture, but for me health comes first and gotta deny.. Yeah but not so many girls are around hunting and fishing areas 😄 I prefer to go hunting in nightclubs and bars 😄 Trust me there are some fine ladies out there in folk dances or other folk events ;) Yeah, one thing is handling a beer or a wine - that's easy.. But I'm talking about going out and drinking 6+ litres of beer with friends!. I think that ""lining your stomach"" with milk is a a old wives tale, before drinking beer.. And the effect if there is any is to make it more expensive to get to that ""good state"" (i.e.. it absorbs alcohol and increases your tolerance).. Obviously when getting home as long as you remember the best thing to do is drink 1L of water, just to stop that really shitty feeling the next day.. Yeah raw milk would help prep, or having a FATTY meal like lubrication formula before hand Afterwards eating raw liver and raw eggs will help your liver function the next day Water is not good to drink afterwards All I know is if I don't drink water I have a splitting headache when I eventually wake-up.. If I drink water before going to bed it lowers all those bad effects.. Drinking milk is risky when getting home - could lead to vomit.. French used to drink glass of wine every day or with every meal and eat raw cream or other raw fat with the meal or in sauces.. That raw fat would bind with the alcohol and not cause such a havoc in the body.. Mead/Mjöd is what I make and I very seldomly drink it, couple times a year a glass or two max.. Doesn't cause problems.. HEADACHES: The common headache is from either high blood pressure (most often caused by eating salt), or low blood circulation, or toxic blood stream.. High blood pressure headache:Mix 2 ounces of naturally sparkling water with 2 tablespoons of unheated honey and the juice of 1 lemon.. Add 6 ounces more of naturally sparkling water and drink.. Usually that relieves this headache in 20-40 minutes.. Low blood circulation headache is accompanied by sluggishness: Mix 2 ounces of naturally sparkling water with 2 tablespoons of unheated honey.. Add 6 ounces more of naturally sparkling water and drink.. Usually, that relieves this headache in 20-40 minutes.. Toxic blood stream headache  is accompanied by nausea: Drinking 1 cup fresh raw orange juice mixed with 3 tablespoons unheated honey usually relieves this headache in 20-40 minutes.. Or drinking 6 ounces good mineral water mixed with 2 tablespoons of raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar, fresh raw juice of ½ lemon and 3 tablespoons unheated honey usually relieves this headache in 20 minutes..

For some reason liver feels the most hydrating to me out of anything When i do Sports, i mix water with raw milk ir whey.. 50% When i take lubrication formula, i feel bloated.. I dont digest It well Have you tried drinking the lubrication formula after eating a big meal?. Aajonus says that is the best time to do it I drink, because I don't have milk Does anyone here know Windspirit in real life?. Please DM me asap if you do.. Thanks.. When i dont have milk, i add It a little cream or butter or eat cheese 5min later",13,209
2877,I have a headache what do I do?. Maybe have some freshly squeezed orange juice or naturally sparkling mineral water with raw honey @xwindspirit is the iridology readings still on?. I made photos of my eyes :),3,37
2878,"Didn't he get banned from here?. What if I don't have appetite for any plant food , just fat like That's why the fat can go to other parts of the body, because the organs and everything won't be able to eat it fast enough Lemon is crucial to make it digest faster For me it's some toxins leaving through scalp and damaging the hair molecules.. Lubrication formula which sends fats to far away places seems to stop my hair loss/shedding almost to 0.. Those fats arrest the toxins leaving, leaving my scalp safe Yes Best thing to do is get your own land, then raise your own animal's You can easily churn cream into butter btw",4,117
2879,"Yea I thought I heard that they have good prices in kiev.... And lots of grass fed animals as well... Is that true?. In time, try testicles.. Nice, arent the prices very affordable out there Crazy, I started around the same time.. Wow that's quite a lot of cream haha.If I overeat fat sometimes i will fell nauseous, but I know that is because my liver isn't in the best shape.. I think that cream should be eaten in moderation, as it is one of the harder to digest fats right under cheese.. Ideally, butter seems to be the perfect fat.... but unfortunately it is hard for me to find as well.",9,112
2880,"A year and some months.. Wbu?. You can't go wrong with extremely high fat, especially on the first couple years of this diet It is if that's what you crave.. No who knows What does this mean",4,37
2881,"Also, what part of Ukraine are you in.. Kiev?. I tried alot of variety of honey but I don't crave it anymore With a meal What about before meat meal",3,30
2882,Have you tried washing It with a raw egg?. More connected to nature I am Happy to help you 😜 Antón I tried a few eggs from the shell and didn't mind the whites at all!.

2883,"Where are you from?. 30 min after is cheese + honeyI take It between 2 meat meals After meat meal is to gain weight quicker.. I think Ive done lube formula on an empty stomach and it feels good too The Bible is a big book lmao Why I don't have cravings for honey anymore Ah damn, yea most countries fall victimized to the grain.. Drives me crazy.. The worst place I've seen for carnivore is Mexico.. Grass fed pretty much doesnt exist there lol What about raw suet Over a couple hours Probably 2 litres is my normal amount But i don't drink six litres of beer at once Lifesaving I just chug milk when i drink too much alcohol Hangover wise, any type of fat would be beneficial.. Cream, butter, eggs.. I think that's why people eat wine with cheese.. The cheese absorbs all the toxins from the wine after you consume it Not sure I can stomach anything when getting home.. One time (before carnivore diet) I had the fire brigade banging on my door, cause I once had idea to make a pizza... and fell asleep!. Whole house was full of smoke!. What you guys think about sourdough bread Yea man let me know if it works for you.. I remember that morning I woke up and everyone else was wrecked, super hungover throwing up and sleeping all day.. It felt like just another day for me.. It was crazy, I was surprised it worked that well.. Also, I only drank vodka the entire night and I mixed every drink with lemon or lime to dilute the potency.Beer is so much heavier, so I dont know if the effects would be different.. But at the same time I was drinking high proof Is it good to eat only fat and organs I am guessing drinking a whiskey is going to be better than drinking beer purely due to volume of liquid.... but then that's gonna get you rekt if not careful.. Just did it with my brother - cause Rocky did it!. FUN FACT: First ever time I drank raw eggs was as like a 8 year old kid after watching Rocky 😄 need to stock up plenty of eggs 😄 OK next beer session I'll let you know 😄 My first month on the primal diet I got stuck into a bad situation while I was out one night with an old group of friends (peer pressure sort of thing) I ended up drinking for the first and last time on this diet.. I heard Aajonus say that the best thing you can do before you go out drinking is to down a bunch of raw eggs.. So I rocky styled six raw eggs down and then had a night of drinking.. Woke up the next day perfectly fine.. Not even a hangover.But in general I hate drinking and party crowds.... so that was the last time haha.. Or Tequila with the authentic worm at the bottom of the bottle.... at least will be some meat eaten and not all bad once that worm is consumed!",28,521
2884,Bread?. I’ve found that raw butter before bed also helps with hangover,2,12

As I juice the vegetables, I pour the juices into  a gallon container.. After I have juiced 92 ounces (not including  foam), I place 3 ounces of juices and 4 ounces of honey in an 8- ounces jar, screw washer/blades/base on jar.. I place the jar  upside down on the blender and blenderize for 5-10 seconds to  thin the honey.. I pour the honey/juice mixture into the remaining  89 ounces and gently stir.. The honey helps to preserve the juices.. Then, I pour the 96 ounces into twelve 8-ounces glass jars.. I fill  the jars to the top, seal with Ball-jar lids and store them in refrigerator.. There should be no more than 1 tablespoon of  airspace in each jar.. My tests showed that refrigerated juices stored that way retained 90 to 93% nutrient value in a 78-hour  period.. just try.. i mix fruits with eggyolks.. I thought it was a lot less than that others most raw As long as everything is raw, I wouldn't worry about the formation of gallstones..

I just mixed it with honey and it was back to decent tasting.Sometimes you have to wait until you have a really cold day in the winter because then what happens is the cows chew the hay and feed for longer durations.... which results in them fattening up.. In return you get more fatty/ creamy milk.Back to deliciousness!. Jersey cows either like it really hot or really cold.. Apparently that is when the milk tastes the best!. Could have been the result of bad milk to begin with.. I've experienced that spinach taste before.. Its atrocious and more common to happen in the winter months yes i see different season different taste 100 percent.. I noticed a huge difference in the milk taste and quality with the season change.I told my farmer about it and he says that it is fine.... so do all the other raw milk drinkers he sells to.BUT, they all drink their milk cold, I drink mine at room temperature.They just chug the milk when it's cold and dont taste it haha.They think I'm crazy I have never had spinach tasting milk yeah it has strong spinach taste i dont like it my butter taste like spinach 🤮 I learned my lesson the hard way But it certainly makes things easier at home if when eating I just have to cook a little bit of meat for them if all I am eating is meat..... still can always go cook up some potatoes I guess if they get bored of meat, meat, meat.. as for kids talking, dont even mention the word raw to them i guess my kid loves bacon they say bacon + liver for those aversion to taste Yeah it's fine.. Maybe I should start her in liver fried in butter to see if she likes liver... some people just hate liver.. lol But I worry about giving my kids raw meat..... if they said something at school ""What did you eat yesterday Billy?"".... ""Oh my Dad gave me some raw liver""..... I think child social services would be round ASAP.. Was it high quality liver?. Unhealthy liver tastes shitty raw my kid too My 2.5 year old loves eating meat..... she sees me eating meat and it's all she wants to eat.. I gave her a little pea sized amount of raw liver to test her reaction - YUK!. I try and cook steaks etc... pretty rare for her.. With ex-ex-partner and kids.. It** Cream with is would've helped lol, shame you can't get it often Well after i ate my raw steak today i got chest pain milkshakes, cooked chicken breast, raw cheese,green juice , cooked beef,kefir im having chest pain in my left those days Yes What do you eat",32,616

I mean even though we know it's crap, I still give my kids a little bit of coke to drink maybe once every 2 months - a birthday, special meal etc.... i do work in the legal industry but am not a lawyer just do it little by little and monitor their well being if your kid is perfectly healthy they have no case Jimmy, like I said, its all about wellness Yea well fuck people stick with the ""safe"" raw stuff to start, no need to start cutting up the raw pork and chicken right away 😛 You can't send a kid to a birthday party and say ""OK, here's your raw meat and water..... don't go eating all the chips, cake and candy"" Or maybe “ate” is the word I’m looking for I mean kids around the world eat raw meat thats lil PA adorable I mean most of my friends think I am crazy eating raw meat..... but nobody can deny I've lost a few pounds, and look a hell of lot better since I started.. It's crazy - you can go give them a can of Coke and many would be like ""oh look he's given his kid a coke, what a nice treat for them"".......... if you handed your kid a raw chunk of steak in the street they'd be like ""he's trying to kill his kid"".. its their well being at the end of the day LOL PA I fucking wish Why not this Natural rubber Found it at a local pharmacy I'll dig the box out of the trash next I go downstairs",11,343

Like we did in sailing trip Massage yourself gently If they got fancy letters in front of their names that's just more reason not to trust them i see doctors recommend lymph massage for some people, so go figure eh nice thanks John for the clarification If you do sauna he recommends to shower every three minutes so that the toxins you expell don't just cake back onto your skin and also to lay on the ground because the air is better That type of qigong Whenever I want I do own sauna which I can use often Apart from that just warming yourself and like moving/stretching Aajonus said lymph massages were too harsh on the body and end up tearing up the tissue, hot water bottles are great if you put them in say your pits or against your throat, apart from that starting your day with a bit of light movement is a great way to stimulate it sup biz they'll use some kind of gel i agree, i am hesitant to try it, but I think its all a part of the healing, otherwise baths seem much better.. There are also some heating pad which use some kind of material that is more malleable and can be wrapped around various places on the body Yeah you should be fine aslong as you're eating lots of eggs and dairy.. Just depends if you're happy healing at a normal rate or not But unfortunately I cant afford to go to lymph massager Hands gently going over or slightly touching the skin i just bought some lard sexy Far from optimal Stimulates lymph and energy flow i thought about it and read Brandons response, which I concur with.. when I wasn't up for eating meat I try to stick with the rest of the regime, if you're not feeling like eating meat from time to time id listen to myself too, but ultimately those cravings come back hi Artem Hello everyone.. What is your experience or thoughts about being a ""primal vegetarian""?. I mean eat all that AV suggested except meat & fish.. My thoughts are that you can still have the mosto important macro, which is fat, from dairy.. Also, proteins from eggs.. So it seems doable 🤔 what a positive inspiration im so happy i have primal friends nice work bro You need meat for increased cellular division, without it you'll heal at the normal rate.. I propably dont have much vegetableoils in my body Yeah I have noticed laying in the bench is much more comfortable than sitting while in the sauna i want to try making some paint out of lard But lymph baths are the best for melting crystallized vegetable oils.. That's why the baths are irreplaceable In general being active helps lymph At some point I did sauna everyday for over a year:D Bring sexy back i am a reiki practitioner of sorts too I like them and we respect each other opinions.. Maybe in the future we will influence each other by looking at our state of health and deduct who was right Ezra Pound is also right here.. By denying meat from yourself.. You're not nourishing your cells and someone will still buy the meat, but he/she might not strive to become a better version of themselves, and to create a better life for animals and other beings around him.By not nourishing yourself, you will make the struggle to achieve self-actualization, health, and well-being of yourself a lot harder.. Thus, you'll make it harder to manifest better life for others.. Would be infinitely better than veganism change your friends.... you will have to do it at a later date as you'll no doubt live longer than they do, and it's harder I imagine finding friends when you're old!. @mikechoo is correct.. I am asking if primal vegetarian could be an option because I have some vegetarian friends who eat crap (I mean real crap) but absolutely no meat.. The reason is that meat has in it the negative karma that passes from the suffering animal (it has been killed) to our personal karma.. I know it is more a esoteric topic, but still I find interesting confronting different points of view.. If primal vegetarian is possible it would open a door to my friends Ok thanks 🙏🙏🙏 K 🇫🇮 thank you, I truly bless my food and I am grateful about having access to it, every time that I remember to do so.. Sometimes I eat forgetting to bless it, but I am working on it.About the possibility of being a raw primal vegetarian : I suppose that eating high quality eggs, dairy, fruits, honey, veg juices if needed, one may still thrive.. But I can't test this out on myself as I have not access to top quality eggs and dairy.On top of that, blessing the food and living a human lifestyle (not big cities, stress, pollution, ecc) may add that bit of energy and prana to sustain a raw primal vegetarian.. But that's just my thoughts Esotericly, you have to bless your food and appreciate where it's coming from.. As long as you're taking steps to a more self-sustainable lifestyle and thus, giving animals a better life than in a factory.. You're working to make things better for yourself and for animals Yes, living outside a city is much healthier than in one https://telegra.ph/Silkie-chicken-01-21 Exactly, I omitted the other things Disagreed.. I have friends that always have supported me.. Althought they have different points of view in several aspectsI love them.. Even comunists ones 😅 I think they would thrive even with medium quality eggs and raw cheese +1 Interesting.. So would I thrive too?. Right now I have access to medium quality eggs dairy fruits and great honey.. By medium I mean the the chickens go outside to eat what they want but they are still supplemented with local italian corn Yes.. But meat, fish and seafood are Game changers..

For what?. its down by admin.. someone who has contact with Slemon?, to ask him in case he wants to provide us with the new access.The book in that format is very easy to consult, share, etc.. Link had changed but I think it was the same quote you copied above 👍 COLD, COMMON,  is  mainly a bacterial detoxification (yellow  to clear mucus) that is sometimes accompanied by fungi (green to clear mucus) and very little or no virus.. Cold detoxification cleanses the respiratory system, connected lymphatic glands and nodes, and brain.. Bacteria  and  fungi  stir  from  hibernation  to  consume  damaged, decaying and dead cells.. That is the natural function of bacteria and fungi in the human body.. After they complete their natural function of consuming  degenerated  organic  matter,  our  bodies  enter  an  intense healing cycle, usually indicated by fever.. When that is complete, our bodies  have  finished a  cycle  of  improvements.. Let  colds  run  their course  by  supplying  nutrients  that  best  facilitates  cleansing  and healing.. Symptoms: chills, cough, fever, headache, muscle soreness, nose and throat  draining, sore  throat,  temporary  loss  of  smell  and taste,  and watery eyes.. Drinking  a  blend  of  4  tablespoons  raw  unpasteurized  apple  cider vinegar, juice of ½ lemon and 4 tablespoons of unheated honey the first thing in the morning helps neutralize toxins.. Eating smoothies that are made by blending 2-3 raw eggs and ½-1 fresh raw unripe banana or ½ cup raw fresh orange juice helps the body make this detoxification through the mucous membranes easier.. Unheated honey may be added if desired.. Getting plenty of sleep allows the respiratory system to rest and clean and if that means taking a day or three off work, all the better for  excellent  health.. Eating  the  butter/honey  mixture  soothes membranes.. Mixing and drinking 1 tablespoon grated raw horseradish root and 2 tablespoons fresh raw lemon juice helps thin mucus that is too thick to cough up.. See the book  The Recipe For Living Without Disease,  Chapter 15, Diet During Symptoms Of Cold, Flu Or Severe Pain..

Everything is sensationalized to the extreme now But it’s also 2020, and stories like this are what sell.. So whatever agenda there is, money from clicks/views also plays a part I've been to USA.. I feel how the common people are disconnected from nature and their ancestors.. Then again, there are some, very few, who are still connected or feel a yearning to connect back to their roots.. Everybody living in Europe and other countries be grateful.The Divided Snakes Of America and Western Culture is beyond toxic and almost everyone here is depressed and sick.. Yea we have super malls, theme parks, women with perky fake tits, and lots of tourists bs cities like New York, Los Angels, Miami, etc.... but they are some of the saddest cities imaginable.. Plus we have some of the most poisonous food you can ingest and the most expensive healthcare in the world.. (How Convenient)If you want to eat super healthy here you better have a ton of money lol.When I was traveling through Europe I felt way more at home and the culture was nowhere near as disappointing.. Some company will be selling vaccines soon.. 😢 It's just toxicity I feel like.. Calling it a name and 'testing' for it is just the usual medical system / vaccine approach.. We will see the agenda in the coming days and weeks.. Whatever is pushed (could be mandatory/available vaccines) will tell us the big picture.. Most likely the way it is handled in public it's a constructed event.. Just like with the Avian flu scare in the past making people take unnecessary vaccines, destroying their health by injecting toxic heavy metals into their bloodstream that goes through blood-brain barrier.. It could be a biological weapon OR the accumulated toxicity of industrial toxins, making people have pneumonia, and the hospitals are instructed to mark them as this ""new"" disease..

I want to try it tbh yes things like that..

I get that i just can't ask understandable question Corona is spread through air, but hiv isn't, then how do they get in in people's bodies Who states that Interesting HIV isn't a natural virus Iraq was in sanction and war with Iran for 8 years but still strong and pushed through.. It was hard days but damn they were producing everything.. Every city in Iraq now is filthy and filled with people who just care about Money, art and fast food.. It’s disgusting But then you have the beauty of simplicity in the country side where people drink camel piss and swim with cows in the Tigris 🥶🥶 😂 Maybe they create it with the structure of a virus but since it's unnatural it causes problems He says that HIV was given to people in the hepatitis B vaccine And if you check out the book, Bio-attack alert, this is further discussed.. They managed to get military documentation of it.. Do the people who create it protect their families by telling them about the right precautions The people who created it are probably living on an island somewhere.. Lmao My friends are all panicked because of the news Do you see where im going If my memory serves correct they were and then they were invaded I wouldn't trust them saying that the virus can be transmitted through the air I see your point now.. And you right and my country was one of them.. Yeah I was thinking if Iraq & Syria were also pushing away from petrodollar That's pure poison I've seen a video with a guy on a metro vomiting blood and shaking, but all people are around him Then again one of the most famous circulating videos is a guy faceplanting and immediately an ambulance arrives to take him lol Yes, the treatment they administer and the mass panic they cause for other people This is a deliberate show to mask the economic collapse.The agricultural industry were hit SO HARD past year and experienced serious crop losses.. China had to buy pork from other countries and even take some porks from their reserves.. What happens when countries close borders?. Global economy takes a hit.. Treatment can kill more than the disease itself.. Yeah the crisis continues and forms into an economic recession soon And SPEED UP your process of becoming self-sustainable.Get animals to grow this year.. Learn gardening as well.. Learn wild edibles.Buy hunting gear.. Learn trapping.. Learn fishing.. Those 2 are great ways to get meat.. Hunting whole day takes lots of energy and calories.. If you are stuck in a city talk to family or relatives about staying at their countryside place if shit goes down in the future and helping them with chores or paying rent to them, or working for them, etc.Don't just show on their doorstep out of thin air.. It's important to not give into panic.. That's what the government wants you to be at.. In fear.. Easy to control.. Life in the countryside is much more peaceful and in tune with nature.. Every day learning something new :) Scandinavia is about the get hella cold (Grand Solar Minimum).. I'd say go where you have contacts, or ancestry People may become more tribal in the future I seriously advice everyone to do this And life will go on again People will form families, tribes, and local regional governments to bring in stability.. Libya Anyone who was tried to become independent from petrodollar has been wiped away by America's military But you’re right, a lot of people are astoundingly dumb with that type of stuff Oh yea there are so many people that are fucking retarded with money.. But there are plenty with a pretty decent grasp on basic economics too True.. I meant the majority of them Especially where I work at now.. A 19 year old with 23000$ car debt When I asked why you bought this car ?. Her answer was “My dream car” I can’t blame her I swear....",35,707
3052,"What do you mean ?. That’s a bit of an exaggeration Yes sir.. Yeah it's a funny world we live in Buying gold is an insurance to carry over your wealth through the recession.. But if it goes way worse gold becomes meaningless.What is most valuable is knowledge and skills.. No one can take those away from you and they will feed you.. Speaking of gold Literally no one in America knows that dollar is backed by thin air but hey work 80h a week I’m learning the planting this summer.. I’m thinking to buy gold what you y’all think?. I’m not in a position where I can afford a land and live off the land.. It's actually backed by the government; military and police.. Yes.. I've been eating beef trimming with cheese until I get my milk separator.. I slept 10h today In spite of going to run through the Hills 2.5h, i decided to sleep more Less.. A pulsating headache on right side.. Now today I had diarrhea.",14,170
3053,"Did you use cheese ?. I computed how much time Aajonus recommends to spend in hot springs Ah, so you bath every day 10 hours for 1 year you'll progress 20 years if doing hot springs 10h a day that amounts roughly to one year so I will be back a few times to the hot springs In what time period?. A week of 10h/days?. Rom lol they were breathing in 2006 the double from mercury that even Aajonus considered ""very high"".. I will redo computation but by memory it was almost an entire year of baths 10h every day",5,100
3054,"More than the one from high brain?. He said every day 1h30 bath for 20 years I feel less toxic in the mornings.. I used to feel ""overwhelmed"" if I didn't take baths after 4 days but not now Thats ages ago sleeping 9-10h every night Olaf the viking can cry",3,51
3055,"How're you now?. This is my new form after >10h of hot springs the last week Based Rom Bringing old and lost wisdom to the peeps.. Hello friends Honhonhon is here.. Hi Rom .. You are here again 💪🏻 😁 yES, imagine now 14 years after, the levels of mercury on Wuhan, sure has increased dramaticatly James It's not toxins causing this its a virus that has HIV genes encoded into it Surprisingly it didn't get dry, even when I was almost fasting and drinking a lot of water, but it got very red and irritated from the things moving out of it.. When it became too much I rubbed kefir but it's safer to do it 20min before any long bath session Interesting, I'm sleeping ~6-7h.. Had a brain detox yesterday that upped my mental capabilities noticeably.. We also have to take into account how much crystallised oil is in our tissues and lymph, so the amount may be less in reality As well as the 2 other tricks: ""primal collada"" and using a rebounder after 10h I like high quality moist beef trimmings too.. But the best gotta be bone marrow ofc due to stem celld yes We met for the first time by organising ourselves in the Facebook group.. I made an event page in it for hot springs trips.. I hope US and Canadians do their own thing facebook.com/aajonus I was thinking about it all the time and craving it.. Craving river water also.. I didn't know after the first group post whether it would happen soon, but after Lisa gave me the right place it was just in time for winter Awesome how well you organized everything and came up with the idea on the first place In my head we're already back there so I don't feel like I left our travelling group or the place!. I made fond memories too and felt accomplished at the end.. running will sweat out daily toxins (45min portion of the bath equivalent), but body regulates temperature so even in hot summer doing intense exercise, you don't reach 101°F Cheese train removes toxins but can't melt lymph congestion, heat that reaches deep into issue does that Not even most intense sports or sauna No only hot bath does And the cheese train every 10 min all day long",15,390
3056,"Running for 3 hours would help to lymph congestion?. That's  a bit how I planned my trip (22 days) although I only spent the last 9 days really over 10h a day Of course, like the most expensive fat possible 🙈 10h a day Finally, his client who did 1h30baths every day for a year (only missing 4 days) at the highest temperature (110°F because of typo in original edition of the book), was a couch potato and 3 weeks after stopping, at 70 years old, gained 2x more energy, worked 14-17h a day and started a stem cell company We also have to take into accounts that 10h in hot springs are not linear.. Maybe after 3h the oils melt even faster for example Aajonus usually doesn't recommend going over 105°F (40.5°C) Temperature of the water also matters, it ranges from 38.5°C (101°F) to 43.3°C (110°F).. Aajonus says it takes from 45min to 1h to start melting lymph congestion, I took the low value here Aajonus says how much time he recommends to take hot baths to completely be free of lymph congestion.Home baths:1h30min/dayfor 20 years45min sweating daily waste dumped under skin, 45min melting lymph congestion=3/4 * 365 * 20= 5475h = 228daysof pure melting lymph congestionWith intense hot springs sessions, how long does it take?Hot springs:10h/dayfor x time(x is the number of days we have to spend at hot springs like this)45min sweating daily waste dumped under skin, 9h15min melting lymph congestionx = 5475h / (9+1/6) = 597days = 1.5year No.. 😊 Nice, but after 45-60min the vegetable oils start melting and coming out so after that the benefits will stackDid you calculate that into it?. @antonleiton Yeah I heard from a local some hot springs enthusiasts went to several hot springs in Spain, one close to Barcelona I think, another in Andalusia.He told me about one where trucks can park right next to it and so it is just too much party 10h every day for a yesr is the same as 1.5h a day for 6.66 years We have Hot springs in Galicia, northwest Spain So before that it will be easy to sweat them out.. Makes sense how athletes who consume vegetable oils and high oxalate foods don't seem to get these problems and can manage eating these processed and damaging foods as long as they vigorously exercise.. Yes and also the vegetable oils crystallize over periods of 5 to 20 years Less time for us young for sure.. Can't wait to build a hot bath barrel in spring.. That would only take 30 days of hot springs Even aajonus said that; The mercury level was very high at 13.3 µg/g (probably because of all of the military and industrial waste from Oxnard and Ventura).https://www.wewant2live.com/mercury-in-fish-do-we-absorb-it/ It gets fucked up, but will recover This is an study from ""mercury in air between 2003-2006""",10,477

No other foods, but av says to close it It depends..

I love beef fat but only if it’s grass fed If it’s grain fed hell no im not doing it haha Never tried this combo Good to gain weight I don’t get as much butter as I’d like since it’s so expensive..

Nah it's edible This has been a mild winter tbh We say the opposite here 🤔 gain weight on winter from richer foods and moving less, lose on summer from lighter meals and moving more And we have mild winters compared to most of you here i mean this winter 2020 is very warm, like barely -1C, and rarely True I know im not the only one who gained weight over christmas In Finland it's been extremely mild and warm in south.. But in the North of Finland, there's usually 50-60cm of snow at this time, but now there's over 100cm Christmas is during summer here in the south but everyone gains weight too 😁 can't blame the weather for this one Jam session Is primal popular there or you like know each other?.

Honey, milk, fruit, and berries shouldn't be demonized But the rest are shit Unless they're cooked And cream.. I think carbs in form of honey and dairy is good Not rice tho Or bread Empty calories That's just cooked grains I miss picking berries in the near by forest in summer I wish I knew about Aajonus when I was younger smh I like black rice Berry's berries Beef eyeballs",8,283

You'll find your people when you look in the mirror.. There's some graphs, a good PDF on that website, and a nice presentation by Adapt 2030.Most likely we're going to experience just a Grand Solar Minimum, but there's always the change that when many cooling cycles come together it could start glaciation.We are due for Ice Age anyways this or the next grand solar minimum Glaciation happens really fast within decades btwIt just takes some snow to survive until next winter Slave diet Southern hemisphere will be affected.. It's already being affected This is from Adapt 2030 (YouTube channel) newest video.. Adapt 2030 doesnt sound like a genuine guy He's a bit weird in a nice way and into spirituality and vibrations, but he does his research well Id be careful trusting him 100% Of course there should be multiple sources of information.. 2 easy to digest channels concerning Grand Solar Minimum are: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI-Am0t4qQaP_Do9FwMWw3Q https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC60fxBZhfGR0yYtveRmPJNg All in all these channels promote at the end of their videos to become more self-sustainable, grow your own food and/or grow your own protein.I find it a positive message in this world where we have become weak and rely on a government as a wheelchair while we could start walking ourselves I see adapt 2030 promoting food packages full grains as prepping material Yeah well most people are not enlightened on all aspects of life And he has promoted microgreens and sprouting seeds 😂 When you don't know where your ancestors come from 😐 Perfect Also France will survive Ice Age too lol but I or my descendants have to migrate Rom @tchret can explain further, but to me it seems it's in an ideal spot in Europe.. Raw dairy everywhere.. Meat is good.. And fruits are good since it's close to spain and northern Africa which deliver veggies and fruits to EU And the media making news, this will come and go just like the other outbreaks All about those clicks Coronavirus is a controlled event.. The global economy was going to crash so the people up top decided to do a controlled demolition.. Greg Mannarino 1/31/20 - Analysis on the market reacting to the coronavirus, crude oil prices, repo market scam and the inverted yield curve.. ""imagine believing the coronavirus isn’t a deliberate distraction from the failing economy and crude oil prices."" They are such masterminds all these people figured out what they are about.... When I watched conspiracy videos (like this one says on the title) I noticed I'd get anxious and other people would annouce doomsday.... I'd very much believe these things are made to make people paranoid, weak and insecure before what they say being true https://youtu.be/KbrfDaaJRQI👆🏻Critical video, shows how our food supply around the world is going through a controlled demolition.. Soon all the agendas will be pushed into hyperdrive; fake lab meat, vaccines, microchip/barcode on skin, 5G, etc., etc...Drop out of the system before you're forced to drop out or forced to walk into a government bus or FEMA camp in search for food, never to come back again.. Ah that's nice Yes, that's right.. FEAR is a tool to control us.. What I advocate is to stop giving your attention to the system, TV, mainstream news, etc.. and start taking small steps towards getting your own power back.. It's about staying on the Dao.. The middle way.Knowing the facts of how horrible modern civilization is.. And then focusing our attention on things we can change in our personal lives and ignoring things we don't have control over.. I wish people woke up to reality before they are forced to wake up.. My cortisol spiked up :') Read the comments there and people are all about end of the world, biblical apocalypse, grow some leafs in your balcony like you would survive on it, I wonder if they aren't wishing for the end of the world.... Good food for their anxieties.... I don't buy for one second this is some depopulation thing, or this is any different than any of the other swine flu, bird flu, ebola and all other news that seemed so important few months ago and nobody talks about anymore That’s where a lot of people stop short.. Many complain about the state of the world and the crazy things that are happening, but very few of them explain the positive changes they’re making in their personal lives Lol yeah I go for the laughs on the comment section after watching The thing with news is that they constantly need to come up with a new distraction that induces fear and spikes hormones.. This coronavirus is perfect for that as have the previous news been too.. WW3 with Iran.. Britain leaving EU.. Etc.. Etc.. Where your ancestors come from and where you have family or relatives would be optimal.. But of course there are optimal Primal countries where starting and staying primal would be very easy.. 🇫🇷 The whole system is based on consent.. And we give it to them for free without noticing.Watching mass media.. Consenting.Buying goyfeed.. Consenting.Going to re-education camp aka school.. Consenting.Of course you can do these things, but know the damage they inflict, and try to quickly advance your own situation towards more self-sufficiency so you can flick the finger at the system.. Fuck carbs I’d like to try some eyeballs Idk but I’m all for raw carnivore Eating a meal on the heavy side is good, because only an egg for example might digest so fast you will not fall back asleep..

I’m brazillian and I was not aware of this I'm not a believer, but try to keep an open mind 🙂 Thanks for sharing.. Looks very interesting.. Lots of the old world folk beliefs and symbols are very connected, since the they come from the nature that surrounds us I looked up the vegvisir and it reminds me of the symbols some Brazilian religions use It's your avatar style for sure 😁 Right now I'm getting pulled towards this ring.. I'm deciding whether to have it on left or right index finger.. Gold and silver are electrical conductors, people used to wear them, now only reserved for the wealthy, I can see deriving health benefits from it.. Kind of, I have past lives relating to the Norse and I do have a bloodline going to Sweden possibly in 1600's.. So it's not far fetched I have Norse ancestors.. It's handmade so it's even more powerful.. Bought it from Etsy.. I've formed a connection and projected my energy of finding my way in this world, and very quickly I started finding things and got a boost to my intuition wearing it.. I have worn a sterling silver necklace for a long time and notice a special bond with it.. It feels like it's improving my intuition and giving me guidance..

If fruit is frozen, it should be eaten very soon after it thaws.. ty man I had the most painful detoxification yet from eating a huge piece of raw salmon I like them, I was just curious And I don't recommend bananas if you have no taste for  them Unripe bananas I'm guessing I think oranges too, but they are too acidic, I wouldn't recommend No, some other fruits if I can remember them..",11,199

Talking to farmers gave me the idea that some supplements as grains are needed if they want to sell a decent amount of eggs.. Otherwise the chicken will produce much less All have ""carbs"" but they boost our health.. or i need just raw meat Starchy carbs are bad and worst of all is processed carbs For sure, I'm just theorizing the best version possible of the primal diet Later I would say it will start with carnivore and then more and more people would go primal Some places are only accessible by donkeyback Also as a mode of transportation This would be the worst case scenario We need animals to farm and to grow Not that it tastes good if your body knows what's up.. Then all that's left is giving animals human rights and killing them will be murder Vegan options constantly being released in supermarkets and restaurants too, people only care about taste and fall for it..

A controlled opposition to a controlled opposition to a controlled opposition Everything has double sides It can be used for good Ai can be used the same as it is used for evil True.. The government adviced diet is ~80% plants They're just gonna accept being controlled by ai Most people will not go primal And then switch to raw But will get much more popular before declining There will be a section of fad bandwagoners for sure High technology and industrial revolution has mainly brought us misery and been a disaster On my way home now Lots of shit in my irises I'm guessing it will take a few years to fully recover from AF I believe that You said the perfect world..

Poor oxygen utilization is sometimes causative.. It is also believed that poor thyroid function is causative, but my experiments disproved that theory.. Eating raw berries with raw coconut cream, a little unsalted raw butter and a little raw cream helps bind with the metals so that they do not cause as much damage to follicles.. Topically, rubbing into the scalp a blended mixture of 1 ounce fresh raw aloe vera gel (directly from the inside of the leaf) and 2 ounces never-been-heated-above-96º Fahrenheit fermented coconut oil helps protect the scalp and follicles.. That usually stops hair loss and sometimes promotes hair growth within several weeks, unless you have an allergy to shampoo.. Drinking naturally carbonated waters helps oxygen absorption.. Drinking some parsley juice with celery juice helps oxygen absorption.. Eating non- steamed dates helps thyroid functions.. Eating 2 ounces of stone- pressed olive oil with meat 3 times each week helps remove dead cells in and around follicles.. A good shampoo is whipped raw egg.. Wet hair, apply and rub whipped raw egg to hair and scalp, let stand for 1-5 minutes and rinse.. Terramin that Aajonus recommend is montmorillionite so i guess i have to look up more Going out every day is optimal.. In addition, in our fat that we have for winter contains vitamin D so bulk up before winter But that is made in freedom land i think they are not advised.. it’s pretty hard to find sunbeds that mimic the real sun, and even then i would be sceptical It's a microwave, it emits huge amounts of EMF's in a closed environment You are literally putting yourself into a microwave Some people here seem to think that it is better to bulk up in winter, but as I said - it's the opposite, follow the nature.. If you want to loose weight, you put yourself Up.. If you wanna gain It, down Try to retain weight in winter and around spring you lose the weight Exactly..

Also, they contain super high water content.... so more bang for your buck Yes im just listening to aajanous he said 4 jucing per day will help you  a lot for times you ate cooked foods 10-12 hours is how much athletes sleep a day I'm not diabetic..

3333,"Why are you on TRT?. Dr Sharashkin discusses the research of Russian  biologists, and other professionals.. Dr.. Leo goes over the work of Russian  biologist Mikhail Prokhorov who was curious why all of the trees, plant-life, and wild-life appear more healthier the further we move away from modern urban cities, and into the depth of wild, untamed nature.. Russian biologist Prokhorov highlighted the role that bacteria plays in the adaptation to changing conditions in the environment.. He goes on to explain that changes in the environment happen all the time.. We have years that are dry, wet, hot, or cold.. Our human genotype doesn’t change overnight.. We humans can only change our genotype once we procreate, which on average is every 20 to 25 years.. We need to be able to adapt to the changes & conditions in the environment almost instantaneously, and every 20-25 years is way too long a time.. This means we have to have some other mechanism set in place, which can help us adapt to all of these rapid changes & conditions in our environment.The key role to our adaptation to changes & conditions in our environment is bacteria.. Humans only change genotype at the rate of every 20-25 years, many bacteria change every 15 to 40 minutes.. This means that bacteria changes 400,000 times faster than us humans.. Bacteria is all around us.. Bacteria is on and in us.. Bacteria is like a medium through which we communicate matter, information, energy and nourishment from species to species.. Our bacteria communicates our current physical state to the bacteria that’s in our local environment, and vise versa, the bacteria that’s in our surroundings environment communicates information on upcoming season’s weather, and other information to prepare our body, and help us adapt to changes.. This was a way our ancestors were physically linked with the rest of organic systems & cycles of earth.. This is real science that justifies reason why our pagan ancestors were so attached to their local land.. It shows us that these people were not some silly superstitious fools, but extremely knowledgeable about physical reality, human anatomy, and hidden cycles & laws of nature https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxJvLb5dznE&feature=share The role bacteria plays in adaptation to the changing of weather & conditions in the environment was also connected to how our ancestors fed themselves, and their families.. Bacteria is everywhere in the soil, on plants & trees, in & on our bodies, and naturally with the organic ecosystem all of this bacteria communicates.... Even cells can transmit information from one to another through field-interaction, by infrared transmissions.. Humans provide bacteria from our bodies into the local ecosystem that produces food for us with our excrement, urine, bacteria, etc..., which all goes to the environment.. So the bacteria we put into our surrounding environment communicates our current physical state to the bacteria that’s in our local soil, plants & trees that grow food for us...In result, the bacteria inhabiting the soil modifies the chemical composition of the nutrients available to the plants.. So this way the plants that grow food for us alter the food that grows in a way that’s required specifically for our bodies, and the bodies of other living beings who eat from same habitat.. In other words, the food bearing plants and trees that grow in that specific location will grow custom made food specifically altered for the species that inhabit that specific areaOur ancestors made sure to put their DNA into their local environment, so that local soil and food bearing plants that grow in that soil received their DNA information, and produced food specifically designed according to this information.. You can now understand what kind of damage we are causing to our bodies, and immune system by consuming foods that come from all over the world and out of season.... We are scattered in space & time.. The bananas we consume today come from tropical humid climate somewhere from South America.. The cheese we’ll eat tomorrow was produced in a cold dry climate somewhere north Europe.. We eat strawberries during wintertime that were produced out of season.... The natural ecosystem gets information through the weather conditions to prepare for whatever season comes next.. The plants that grow food receive information and already know what type of season is coming, be it  hot, cold, rainy, etc...These plans grow food according to this information.. They grow custom made food specifically for that ecosystem/location, climate, and environment, and all of the local species that feed on this food receive the nutrients & vitamins their bodies require to make their immune system strong, and prepare them for the next season...So when we eat food from different ecosystems, climates & environments instead of eating locally and in season, we are not physically linked to our local, natural ecosystem., we are disconnected from the complex organic system of earth, and we are not living according to hidden laws of nature that were set in place long before humans appeared here....

He likes Aajonus and he is his “teacher” But he thinks juicing is better than water which dehydrates you water dehydrates you???. we would have been extinct ^ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SJIMFWOua9c Well, if he listened to 350h of lectures He would have known what’s aajonud take onAnti-nutrients Organs and other things.. He brought big awareness to the primal diet but not the proper way and he took it to extreme.. ah another statement which needs qualification.. it’s only applicable if you are doing full raw but just saying water dehydrates in general on the otherhand..... also that article on intermittent fasting, using SAD as reference diet is ..... 🤦‍♂️ Water dehydrates even on a cooked diet You still need water tho.. Except if you have milk.. Then you need only a little water if at all Aajonus drank 1 cup of water a day in the summer In the winter 1 cup a week max In Asia without juice he drank 4 cups a day but he didn't like it Yeah Yes 😳😳😳",10,172

3343,"how did aajonus prove that gulping liquids rushes them straight to the kidneys?. or is there a study somewhere?. There should be a study But it's very easy to notice when putting awareness into the body i mostly stopped gulping before primal diet so i think yeah i became aware it wasn't a good thing one thing I still like very much is cold milk luckily i dont get cramps Yes i dont like warm temp/soured millk as much.. cold kefir is alright though it seems to me it loses its sweetness Kefir is okay cold if you sip it because it's predigested.. i dont have a problem digesting cold raw milk if i drink it slowly for instance, 8 oz over an hour or so but yeah of course it gets warmed at the end but i could just drink 1-2 oz cold every 15 minutes Look “2 years of raw meat & juicing” I prefer milking temperature I prefer room temp milk to cold.",5,166

But juices and milk are the first to go if thirsty water is the last resort I haven't drank water from tap for over a year But i don't think water is that dangerous as cooked meat and in little amounts wont do harm Everyone needs a little solvent Nobody needs carcinogens Also if i take little sips its fine , only when i have gulps Yes water is important for some to create solvents",3,116

I think we would drink some sips of water throughout the day if we lived in a very humid climate and probably consume almost no water in the colder climates.. I haven't drank water in 6 months.. I feel fine, but that's because I drink lots of milk.... if I didn't have milk though, I would probably want to drink more vegetable juices, coconut water, or even small amounts of rain/ ground/ river water daily.",7,103

He is asking of the meat has a bad mouth breath i think Lol 😂 I wonder if they are still primal City family was so fake no i mean im having bad  breath but still on cooked meat other are raw The dirty house and teeth didn't do any favor.... I believe this is caused by the tissue in your intestines decaying.. Assuming you're on primal of course.. Aajonus book have an answer, and what to do Brush ur teeth or chew gum There has to be some primal gum thing we can chew on i think will do coconout or olive oil + baking soda Buy more jars.. why on this video those feels a bit not normal , like when started crying etc Yeah Now I got something good to watch tonight yes looks like they had mental health trouble maybe trying to heal this is not good if you are trying to tell someone switch to raw lol You can't help people unless they're open to it anyway, who cares how you represent the diet on a TV show?. The people who are sick and actually trying to figure out how to heal, will see this and research it more themselves.. People need to want to change, you'll waste a lot of your time if you try to change others.. yes but , some people try to tell everyone about raw and they will sound crazy , if they speak to everyone Who cares?. Let them do that until they realise that they can't help them.. Aajonus realised this, and so he didn't try to convince anyone to do anything.. All he did was fight for the rights of people who did want to follow his diet, and offer people solutions that they could choose to do and heal themselves, or not.. yes when people are sick they try everything to heal medicine, supplements,drugs,some plants & herb like curcumin, honey etc Give people access to the information and lead by example, that's all you can do.. Don't resort to vegan tactics lol, they make themselves look like fools.. (Of course they are fools for being vegan in the first place) I guess , then the snowballing starts",15,374

Probably a good thing Brandon you have a lot of energy :D He has a problem with parroting Aajonus, despite Aajonus having actually researched this sort of thing.. I told him that it was probably intestinal damage Michal HALITOSIS is a foul odor emanating from the mouth.. In hygienic  people, only 1% of “bad breath” comes from decaying teeth.. The other  99% of “bad breath” comes from a toxic intestine where foods have  putrefied.. Some putrid gases in the intestines pass into the blood and  expel from the lungs.. Eating unheated honey often (and, when available, plain raw kefir)  supplies enzymes necessary for better digestion.. Eating fresh raw  parsley, or other fresh raw aromatic herbs, or fresh raw vegetable juices  or fresh raw pineapple or papaya aids digestion and sweetens breath.. Very seldom does anyone on a raw diet have bad breath, and only  during detoxification.. Some people are ill-effected by the putrid gases of bad breath that areemitted by other people.. Those people get a headache when they are  within two feet from someone who has bad breath.. Many people who  drink alcohol have a destructive chemical reaction that causes their  breath to smell like airplane glue.. Many people who do not drink alcohol  have breath that smells like airplane glue.. Some people get nauseous,  claustrophobic and headachy when enclosed in an unventilated room  with someone whom has breath that smells like airplane glue.. Following the same suggestions above alleviates the gaseous ill effects  suffered from someone else’s bad breath.",16,278

I don't know dude my breath is fine i always ask reliable people who would not lie to me, i had bad breath when i was not primal , still some experimenting to do, if eat only once per day after some time there might be some smell, but i eat fat and meat bit by bit true the day and i have a feeling its a detox thing and the fat helps it.. I have met people with bad mouth smell and they are not primal.. But still experimenting to do Bad breath is almost inevitable on raw primal.. Especially after drinking raw milk, eating liver, and other potent meats.. Aajonus mentioned quite a few times throughout his lectures that when he met with various indigenous tribes.... their breath was atrocious.. Aajonus even said himself that people admit he is very healthy, yet the only thing they complain about is that his breath stinks.If we were living in nature, everyone would have foul breath... so everyone would be used to it.. Due to society, we feel paranoid of bad breath when talking to people....

Experiment and share it with us I think you're having way too little lemon Those fats will just get eaten by closest tissue because they will be digesting You need more lemon to predigest the fats so they can rush to feed far away places.. The honey, lemon, and raw egg predigest the butter.. This simple formula is achieved by years and even decades of research.. The ratios are precise like an autistic person would've made them.. Ok so more butter less eggs and more lemon And what happens if I mess with the ratios?.

I feel a lot of energy , clear mind when i eat the brain Search ""dried meat"" on aajonus.online and go to the timestamp on that workshop.. Gives you a boost Wasn't he talked about stuff like beef jerky who is really dread?. I was thinking of what would be the best way to preserve a sheep , i would consume a sheep in about 2 weeks.. If you leave it in vacuum seal it kinda goes bad after 1 week not that tasty.. So when you slaughter you leave the meat to dry a bit , its easy to cut it and its more tastier.. Then until you consume that animal let the meat sit outside on a string.. Only the outside lose some part of the moisture the middle keeps it :D Only if you have a shit tonne of enzymes with it I guess.. Otherwise I'd rather eat frozen tbh.. Just let go man I remember the first time I ate brain, had crazy, vivid dreams Ground meat has been forced through tiny holes at high pressure (homogenisation).. It's good for detoxing, but the fats are useless for anything else.. There are better ways to do that anyway, so there's no need for ground meat.. Most people like thinly sliced raw meat the best, try that.. Well yea you should try to eat fresh but its a lot better to dry age, especially if you have your own animals Rather then freeze Dry aged meat is good for times of food shortage.",15,267
3457,"Do enzymes survive freezing ?. Doesn't make sense Enzymes aren't alive..... Some enzymatic activity can be restored after defrosting.. Frozen is the worst you can eat No, cooked is the worst.. I'm not 100% sure, but I think so assuming a natural environment where you don't have access to enzyme rich foods to supplement the dry aged meat.. Freezing damages nutrients, but doesn't produce all the toxins that cooking does.. Yes cooking is worse , but in terms of raw The best that comes after fresh is dry aged or high How else you would preserve the food Just have the frozen meat with some non frozen fat and you'll be fine, it's not optimal of course, but unless I had infinite honey and I had to choose between only dry aged meat, or only frozen, I think I'd go with frozen.. Well Brandon read the 188 page of we want to live I have, I've also heard lectures where he specifically talks about frozen meat It's okay if you have it with some fat, but not optimal.. I'm not comparing frozen to fresh though.",9,185
3458,wait .... he said that freezed meat produce more e coli bacteria?. Brandon you choose dry aged not frozen Certain types of fats are missing from dairy.. Animal fat has a complete profile.. Dry aged meat is only for famine.,5,40

You are surrounded by sea Yeah, just not Atlantic tuna For me personally ground meat is awful, strange taste, and not that fun to eat But my dog loves it That's especially important for certain conditions, like spinal same Has to be grass fed for me, otherwise I hate it If you have to eat ground meat, make tartare Much more appetising and easy to make.. Egg yolk is not tasty to me too",4,152
3465,"It should be kinda sour ?. I just chug the eggs, i don't taste the yolk Haha, then have the egg seperate.. I think Turkey is one of the worst tasting meats",3,32
3466,"Are the eggs good quality?. Don't know , not the best",2,11
3467,"I wouldn't know because I haven't tried it raw, did you get good quality?. I tried it was fine for me, tasted like chicken and corn, kinda liked it It's also possible that the egg yolks are detoxing your taste buds, that'd mean that eventually you'll like them.. Otherwise you just don't like eggs.. Quality was okay Maybe you got unlucky I know people who absolutely love the yolk , time will tell It won't be able to detox your tongue if you just chug it though Im sure wild caught Turkey would taste way better I bought some organic turkey from the grocery store.. Tasted bland af I tried chicken fed combicorn, the chicken had a lot of meat but tasted really bland, did not like it The best tasting raw meat for me was when I first had mackerel raw.. I want to try raw tuna, but I don't want to eat anything from the Pacific and I haven't found Atlantic tuna anywhere I am sure you can find good quality fish in england For some reason milk with ground beef is a wonderful tasting combo and rn ground beef tasted awful i dont know honestly.. you could dry it outside in the sun if you prefer.. next time i will take the dried beef, grind or chop up real fine, and mix it with suet or slightly melted tallow like the native americans.. they used to carry this stuff in a leather pouch and it would keep the fed for days as they traveled the countryside hmm interesting I put the hot/warm water in my blender, put the jar in and close the top on the blender..

I have a lot of it unused also, im guessing the leaner meat is better unless you want funky smelling and tasting fat oops i see now Yeah I thought about it but haven’t tried it yet The salt never touches the meat, it just sits at the bottom of the tray.. It’s just there to suck the moisture out of the air and keep it dry.. I use coarse Himalayan pink salt, but I’m sure other salts would work.. Coarse grains are good coz they reduce the risk of the salt accidentally ending up on the meat as you handle it.. This can work without salt too as long as you have a fairly dry environment, I’ve heard of people putting a portable fan inside the fridge to create a slight draft, but I never tried that myself.",8,191

A lot of plants in stores are treated somehow and they don't even say with what it was treated.However i have read this in some simple articles so information not that good quality.But it said that for example carrots are dipped in chlorinated water.Strawberries sprayed with fungicides and other chemicals to not make them go bad fast..

That sounds like a good plan 😊 Sounds really awful true and bad health is stopping me from my dreams and objectives And less stress equals better digestion i was doing good in WAP diet , so after i calm down my gut i can then go to advanced healing like primal yes thats why im thinking to go slowly because i think my gut is a mess , from antibiotics ,ppi,candida antibiotics and a lot of things , so maybe i can after 6 or more months switch slowly to primal and see progress as anton with weight 😃 yes for 1 week i was full primal till today I tend to notice that some people can't make it through hard times even when others support them, try not to be those kind of people..

3530,"How long you been on primal before getting the cavity drilled out?. Why make such a big deal?. If you need to indulge in certain foods then do.. Some people can't make big changes all of a sudden, they need to gradually implement changes in their daily life until they are doing something to the fullest.. I started with some raw meals until I went fully raw and if I crave a stew in the middle of the winter I'd rather do that once than become obsessed and stress about it.. Now I crave less and less cooked food but if I had to go from 0 to 100 in one day I wouldn't have sticked to it.. Mental health is also being able to relax about food.. And overall health depends a lot on our mindset.. +1 same here yep thats why im going to do gaps first then switch to raw , but sometimes my brain goes crazy ,im too tired of beign sick etc , i cant be much focused and scale my job + learn new things so i get dissapointed even when i see pression of my family they still think it has to do with psychic from stress and depression Whatever you decide, if you do a diet because you want to heal, the worst thing you can do is turn in into something stressful, because stress will stop you from healing.. Try GAPS if you think it's easier for now, but you could for example do a couple of tartares a week, if you can find raw dairy around you then try to make that part of your daily diet as well.. And most importantly, just focus on what foods hurt you and try making sure that you are not having those, it makes such a huge difference 😊 GAPS diet already im familiar with , i did that last year 3 months , i can inculde with gaps raw meat 1xdaily Oh cool Then that's awesome Sorry I didn't read that But yeah then again if it's too much for you right now don't push it, I don't see the point, you will end up hating it Yeah, too many changes in a short amount of time is really bad in my opinion.. Our body needs time to adjust and it's less stressful when it's gradual Salt took me a long time Anyway thanks to all hope this year is year of healing 🙏🙏🙏 Ugh Brandon, lets not be vegans.. For some it takes time.. Try doing the eggs like I said rather than normal primal, I kept getting Crohn's flare ups with raw meat initially thats nothing , if we had sore throat we just would get a ospen drug which later someone told us is antibiotics a lot of drug whole my life and stomach issue since kid so i think a lot of time to heal i would get stomach cramps Will be withdrawal, not detox and headache i think from many eggs also i forgot las year april i was doing around 20-25 supplements drugs per day or more lol You need to eat a lot to gain fat on a raw diet, and you need the nutrients.. about a month ago i got a cavity drilled out and now, 2 inches below where they injected the novocain/whatever, my lymph node is swollen and painful 🤔 Detox.. yeah tooth pain too.. detoxing Either keep going or don't moan about it, healing takes time :) I was joking because you said antibiotics twice Yeah I know that works fine for some people, my boyfriend did that as well Wow, that's a lot of antibiotics I'm an all or nothing kind of guy myself So yeah just chill, you have nothing to prove to anyone",17,635

My gut was messed up when I first started drinking milk and I would get painful gas.. Just needed to ferment the milk to get the bacteria back to digest it Well i don't know what's exactly wrong with your digestive system but i would put more to slow down the process Ok maybe needs to try a larger amount of kefir?.

Even if you don't use brine, the outer layer must be salted for aging.That is why i choose farmers cheese as the main cheese.The wastness of the internet and no recipe without salt for aging hard cheese like gouda, Parmesan,Cantal except taking farmers cheese and letting it age.Hard cheese means you use a lot of force on it , you press it hard, that is what it defines it.. Taste comes later when you let it age.. Press like this You can make hard cheese at home with a press and less moisture in cheese, to do that you will need to keep the curds with whey in pot longer, the longer they stay in warmth the less whey they hold (shrink too) and the stronger you press the more moisture leaves it.. That is how you have a hard cheese.What is left is to leave it at right temperature to age or you can eat it as it is.. How much But that does not mean that it is not possible, but i would imagine it would be hard if you don't want the cheese to have other bacteria  adding their own taste to it..

A person who needs temporary relief from a continually heavy painful detoxification may discourage that detoxification by taking 102o-107o Fahrenheit, 1-11⁄2-hours baths 3 days apart.. Immediately before each bath, the bather should drink a blended mixture of 1⁄4-1 cup unripe lime juice, 3-7 tablespoons coconut cream, 1-6 teaspoons raw dairy cream or 2-6 tablespoons avocado.. Measured ingredients should be equal for suggested amounts, that is, for a person who is 4’-4’6” the smallest amounts of each ingredient to be blended is 1/3 cup lime juice, 3 tablespoons coconut cream, 1 teaspoon dairy cream or 2 tablespoons avocado.. A person who is 4’6”- 5’2” should blend 1⁄2 cup lime juice, 4 tablespoons coconut cream, 2 teaspoons dairy cream or 3 tablespoons avocado.. A person who is 5’3”-5’9” should blend 2/3 cup lime juice, 5 tablespoons coconut cream, 3 teaspoons dairy cream or 4 tablespoons avocado.. A person who is5’10”-6’2” should blend about 3⁄4 cup lime juice, 6 tablespoons coconut cream, 5 teaspoons dairy cream or 6 tablespoons avocado.. A person who is 6’3”-6’10” should blend about 1 cup lime juice, 7 tablespoons coconut cream, 2 tablespoons dairy cream or 7 tablespoons avocado.. After the bath, the bather will be weak.. The bather should move slowly from the bath, and sit to dry.. Bundle in very warm natural clothing and take a 30-45-minute easy walk.The hot-bath routine above works by instigating the healing cycle that relaxes bacteria, putting them in hibernation, and discouraging cells from producing virus.. Those are the same effects produced by fever.. Fever is an important and beneficial feat of the body.. Fever ends microbe and viral proliferation and initiates intense healing (cellular division/reproduction).. Usually, fever is accompanied by necessary lethargy that transforms into tiredness.. Rest, relaxation and sleep are important because most healing occurs during those states.Or a less beneficial alternative for stopping painful persistent detoxification for the elderly, is to eat a cooked meal once weekly..

3679,"is typhus eating degenerative tissue?. About pasteurisation for sure weird “THE SAD HISTORY OF RAW MILK:Pre-refrigeration, the farmer and close local residents got to enjoy fresh milk for the first few days (especially if it was winter), the surplus got actively or passively clabbered (essentially yogurted or kefired) and was eaten as clabber, buttermilk, yogurt, kefir etc.. Then after a while, the proteins got converted into cheeses for the dry stretches, when there was no milk, or as a source of additional concentrated sustenance.. The fats got separated and eaten or rendered (ghee) for better shelf life, the whey was fed to the animals for a nutrient rich cold soup.. No muss, no fuss, no waste, no long distance transportation, no pollution.. Each subsequent rendering of this raw milk lost some of the original nutritive qualities, but gained some additional nutritive qualities it did not have before.. Thus it was all good.. I call it 'Kind Processing'.. It is only in our current milieu that all nutrition is lost in one fell swoop.. We pasteurize, steam heat, pulverise, homogenize milk and call it potable.. Its not.. Its a toxic beverage.. All immunoglobulins are dead, BAMLETs dead, lymphocytes dead, macrophages dead, lipases, proteases, bifidus, lactoferrin dead, phosphatases dead, vitamins dead, dozens of other  enzymes dead, the colloidal structure of milk (so easy to digest) becomes destroyed.. The charge separation that makes milk a beautiful naturally homogenized colloidal solution disappears post the industrial homogenization.. The minerals get precipitated out, the fantastical sterero isomeric proteins with precise spots for your body's receptors to latch to, become flattened and denatured from heat pasteurization, and milk becomes indigestible, allergenic, toxic, unrecognizable to your body.. At this point it is nothing but sugar water with denatured proteins, blended bacterial toxins and industrial detritus (fat is stripped out for ice cream, a value added sugary dessert that fat deprived premenstrual females and growing children crave - because they are drinking 1% milk the other times).. What is left is highly insulinogenic, all carbs no fats, just lots of sugar and indigestible proteins - causing diabetes, heart disease, alzheimers, cancers.. This is what the USDA has mandated we feed our children in schools btw.. Children whose brains are 70% fat.And thus milk, a previously sacred food eventually gets eliminated from your diet to be replaced with genetically modified, Round Up laced soy beverages which generate 80% profit margins, even with heavy investments in packaging and marketing.. One 'scientific and industrial' intervention leads to another until eventually the food is nothing but a joke.. I hark back to images of my grandmothers, lovingly feeding their cows/buffalo the best fermented silage they could afford, taking care of them like they were a family member, and nourishing their whole family with this life giving substance - over lean and fat months.. Grandmothers in large joint families who took on, and presided over this important task had grandchildren that popped out easily, were sturdy, beautiful and with wide dental arches.. No doctors needed.. Nutrition is that powerful.. Brahmins from the Konkan coast of India where my ancestors come from, who were largely vegetarian otherwise, did not have rampant diabetes, heart disease and mental disease.. The women were lean and had glowing skins.. The elderly lived a long, long time.. They ate a pretty high animal fat diet.. I recall eating gobs of cultured butter growing up.. Butter is brain food and fertility food.I urge you to develop relationships with your local farmer and try some fresh, high fat raw buffalo or jersey milk.. It heals asthma, joint disease, gut disease, autism, cancers, skin conditions, mental disease and a whole host of chronic conditions.. Infact raw foods, particularly raw animal foods are the only thing that will heal your chronic conditions.. Good milk is medicine, not just food.”- Sushama Gokhale modern hunting crazy isnt it that we have to put so much time and money to get real food lol Still wondering if i should add grass fed heated butter or ghee ,I eat 20~ raw eggs a day(organic , probably vaccinated)2 pounds of seabream fish(pretty lean)And a bit of beef muscle meat(grain fed) I say this in regard to the cheese he posted as an example What i mean is if you dont have it raw cooked is better than none Same logic applies to cooked meat > no meat or doritos with as little additives..

High blood pressure headache: Mix 2 ounces of naturally sparkling  water with 2 tablespoons of unheated honey and the juice of 1 lemon.. Add 6 ounces more of naturally sparkling water and drink.. Usually, that relieves this headache in 20-40 minutes.. Low blood circulation headache is accompanied by sluggishness: Mix 2 ounces of naturally sparkling water with 2 tablespoons of unheated honey.. Add 6 ounces more of naturally sparkling water and drink.. Usually, that relieves this headache in 20-40 minutes.. Toxic blood stream headache is accompanied by nausea: Drinking 1 cup fresh raw orange juice mixed with 3 tablespoons unheated honey  usually relieves this headache in 20-40 minutes.. Or drinking 6 ounces  good mineral water mixed with 2 tablespoons of raw unpasteurized  apple cider vinegar, fresh raw juice of ½ lemon and 3 tablespoons  unheated honey usually relieves this headache in 20 minutes.. Cluster headaches (also called “suicide headaches”) are successively occurring headaches that grow in intensity, usually immobilizing the sufferer.. Cluster headaches occur in a body laced with volatile toxins, usually from excessive adrenaline, accompanied by low blood fat and low body fat levels.. Cluster headaches are somewhat allergy related.. Avoiding the following foods and substances usually solves the  problem: caffeine (including aspirin, coffee, chocolate, and sodas),  alcohol, processed sugars, cheddar and jack cheeses (even if cheeses are raw), salt and anything made with baking soda.. For cluster sufferers over  age 25, following these suggestions for at least 3 days weekly for several months before the cluster season begins usually prevents reoccurrence: abstain from the foods listed above and eat cooked starches with plenty of raw fat and tomatoes, and eat fresh raw fish  (salmon is more often the most effective).. Migraines are sudden headaches that fluctuate in intensity, usually  occurring on one side of the head.. Sleeping is the best relief.. When awake,  eating a little spoonful of unheated honey every five minutes and avoiding all other food, especially avoiding meat and dairy, eventually  relieves migraines.. If thirsty, sipping some good mineral water, or some fresh raw orange juice with an equal amount of unheated honey is helpful.. #headaches jup, war oefter da und hab mit denen gesprochen.. ich wuerde aber den dt..

At first i had a lot of improvements.. I'm not a fan of any of them: Bobby, Frankie Boy, even Vegetable Police (although he is funny.) These guys all spread misinformation and claim that a completely raw diet is unhealthy.. They are addicted to their cooked comfort foods, but wont admit it.. Ah yeah That's why i want to see his reaction if there's even a reaction Thomas explain Wtf is this Women are walking bullshit detectors He'll truly get so much attention 😂 + he was laughing while denying he's gay as if he has everything under control even if he gets exposed.. He was right... He's fcking smart, if he didn't make this up by himself, he'll prolly keep quiet pretend like nothing happened and lgbt lobby will do the rest to humiliate his criticism.. But i have a feeling that he made his ""gay denying"" vid on purpose, to utilize his coming out.. It was obvious that he's not full hetero, and ofc he knew that he went viral with his naked ass and dildo on cam, so he made ""denying"" vid hiding truth in a plain sight (like Clinton did ;) and now he can cry for all the hate for beeing a gay, discrimination etc, make the story heartbreaking and in the end he can double or triple his viewer base, become some main stream media career or just use lgbt lobby in the way he wants to.. Not only video...i can't find his channel Bobby just makes lame reaction vids 😂 Overall, I prefer Frank to Bobby.. Even if he's gay or whatever he explains concepts well and finds interesting info Ye, now all normies will beeee after Bobby like some fcking sheeps.. Bobby ofc buried his head in the sand and made the vid ""private"" ... fcking coward Women notice such things way faster then men.. Not necessarily that he lied, beeing e.g.. bisexual it's not strictly beeing a gay.. He's smart and he carefully choosed his words in his vid, like ""engaged"", you don't have to be engaged to fck smbody 😁 Frankie may be narcissistic but at least he's intelligent, Bobby on the other hand is a dumbass, he was vegan/frutarian/vitarian for like 2-3 years ?. Cmon, only an idiot would do it for such a long time, then he ate magick mushrooms that told him to eat animals LOL Frank claims that all of our ancestors at a diet of raw meat, fermented foods, and also cooked meat.. He believes that every tribe in history cooked their meats.... so he rationalizes that all raw isn't sufficient.. I believe he only claims this theory so that he can appeal to a wider audience and be more mainstream to market his free range meat company.. That way he can be more friendly and make ""What I Eat In A Day"" videos of cooking meats on the grill with seasonings and recipes..

We can buy ""raw"" legally from milk vending machines, i tryed to ferment it and failed, did some reaserch on it and i found that law allows ""raw milk"" to be heated to 104 F and still be labelled as ""raw"" .... Not as good as farm fresh but still good I'm in Malaysia now, but raw milk is legal in California and can be bought at groceries What happens to those who criticize av",14,365

3700,"Where did you grow up ?. Yea, sry i'm using shorthand, just realized im thinkin locally, and ppl use ""fat"" to name it I grew up in a place that mostly disregarded lard and animal fat Its the same here.. But i still get it , some parts are like 80% fat 20% and some mostly meat.. It depends This is a good point.. Basically the answer is that i can't find good raw bacon nowadays in my place.. And by good bacon i mean the one with at least 60-70% of fat.. Most bacons i se got like 20-30% of fat ... Also rip Frank Tufano.. I don't think he will ever recover..

Lard is the fat from the abdomen of a pig.. I changed what i wrote Nice, both are delicious Hm, i got a feeling i'm an idiot that thinks he knows engrish 😁 On that photo it's  raw fat from a pig (i thought it's called lard, or am i wrong ?) in the place i live it's called ""słonina"" Yeah it fermented fine..

It's possible to get it only from farmers Pork was the best thing i have gotten.. Its really nice to chew.. I used to get Beef fat but it was really hard, dry and not that nice to eat( some rare parts of fat are nice and melts in your mouth but only 7% of all the fat, in summer a lot more, in winter a lot less) It seems from my experience that when you slaughter an animal all the fat is good and soft but when it loses its temperature some fat becomes dry and hard..

I copied his method, but i felt terrible after bath, so i guess if didn't work for my tap water.. I was wondering if there is some iron in your thermal reservoir and eventually how you feel after the bath.. Chlorine reacts with organic matter and makes poisons Yea, tds is fine for some basic measurements, i checked it with ppl that do testing proffesionally and it shows more less particless density in water Tap water contains chlorine and should not be drinked anyway.And if you would test ppm of spring water you could be mislead.. If you see old thermal reservoir, there can be shit from rusty walls inside and if you see spring coming from rocks, it's what nature made it, so in these 3 scenarion ppm can be everywhere like ~200 Listen up, if you see tap water, you more less know that it's not mountain spring, water isn't structured for sure, there is shit from pipelines and there is shit that they put in water supply company.. Yea, i took destilled water with me when i was doing my ""home"" testing, and it showed me 0 But more particles doesn't mean its worse then less particles.. Distilled water would show 0 right ?.

Yeah they dry Its polyunsaturated fat that has been oxidized small bits of vegetables are okay with raw meat right interesting @RawArt ""I found only this message which was talking about virus herpes simplex.. I would like to discuss it further""I think that it's much deeper then all you can find in exoteric knowledge (including all that AV said about it).. First of all word ""virus"" is an old latin word they took and converted to a magic word about one century ago.. It's closely related to counterculture and depopulation agenda.. Throughout all these years they use newspapers, mass-media, so called science, public education etc to create subconscious image in the society, that ""virus"" = we.. In german ""wir"" means we, ""uns"" means us, in english ""vir-us"" also puts ""us"" to subconscious mind.. They cast this ""spell"" whenever they can <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5foZIKuEWQ"">example</a> It makes ppl think ""we're like a virus and virus should be removed"" (depopulation agenda).So what about the substance ?. well it's a poison (just like the litteral latin meaning) or rather poisons, in ezoterics they knew about it since forever.. All creatures make some poisons, no matter whether plants or animals.. Before industrial era, these poisons disinfected and killed germs when one got e.g.. wounded.. Nowadays body uses them as solvants to get rid of toxic industrial waste, but it's not their main task, it's kinda like circulatory system takes over what lymphatic system should do, but it's not what circulatory system was meant to do.. For winter it was easy to get fat.. But now I feel I don't eat nearly as much anymore On primal my instincts are taking over I feel I'm going to a starving phase naturally @RawArt ""But I was wondering why it appears periodically and in such a bland form even if I finally got my diet sorted out""People have lived in harmony with annual cycles of nature for centuries.. There is a starvation period in spring (usually in march) among primitive tribes around the world and also animals.. They don't eat or eat very little, so if the body is regularly in fasting state, it adapts to it.. This is why all animals (including human body) that don't e.g.. hibernate in winter and starve in early spring evolved this increased apoptosis and increased bacterial activity period commonly called ""spring cold"".. Nowadays ppl don't follow natural seasonal cycles, so their body freaks out and randomly switches to a cleansing state (especially during hormonal disorders).. I found only this message which was talking about virus herpes simplex.. I would like to discuss it further.I have lived with herpes since I was a child.. It appeared on my face quite randomly for a period forming “bubbles”.. On ears, lips or nose.. Doctors told me I have it inside my body forever and whenever my immune system was weak, the virus manifested itself.I realized since going vegan, fruitarian and eventually raw primal that its manifestation still occurs sometimes but it is way less potent.. Meaning that the “bubbles” are very small and the period on appearance is less than half the time I was a boy.So does it really manifest when I am stressed?. Usually I just put some honey on the spot and in less than a week it disappears.. But I was wondering why it appears periodically and in such a bland form even if I finally got my diet sorted out.. The world is dumb from all the vacines and its leaders have banned the only top nutrient source which is wild meat and sent 5g radiation upon them.. Eggs oxidize in the air.. Thats not how high eggs are made.. Your egg is going to dry out.. You just hit it with something like the back of a spoon which will create microscopic cracks and it will ferment that way.. Not make a large hole Little bit of mold shouldn't be a problem, unless bacterial culture is dead (when it's dead, it has bad putrefied smell and alot of mold, when it's alive it has pleasant fermented smell and no mold).. My family always did sauerkraut in anaerobic way (they covered barrel or a jar with something like he does) ive red somewhere that the cracks / holes should be very big - ƒailed deluxe i always get that with sauerkraut after about 2 weeks, might be ok to eat idk",36,753
3751,thx.. the smell is still pretty nice.. so should i skim the green mold?. never tried  raw chicken so im excited to make a chicken salad and some homemade mustard and mayo wiill  be picking up some soy free chicken breast 👍👍👍 Fermented veggies alkalize the digestive tract..

3752,"We call it citron.. Should it work as a lemon?. I'm doing some notes after watching AV materials and i remember he talked about fermented veggies somewhere, i'll take a look at them and post a link to that vid here in the evening.",3,44
3753,"No?. And make sure cabbage is not sprayed with pesticides.. but apparently if ur eating it with raw meat it rots in ur gut, doesnt get utilized Hm, all fermented veggies alkalize body even more then fresh do, so they reduce ability to digest meat.. I stopped eating sauerkraut after i started raw animal primal diet (fermented veggies just reject me, don't have any cravings for them).. I ate them before when i was on cooked carnivore diet, but now i crave only some fresh veggies.. Mold will always grow if there is some access to oxygen at the surface, you can be fine doing it like Sandor Katz (with a barrel and wooden lid), mold won't grow enought to kill bacterial growth.. Also you can use anaerobic jars like this guy does (notice he uses dark glass jars, very good idea, coz lactic acid fermentation bacteria is sensitive to light).. When i was doing my sauerkraut, i used one big cabbage leaf to cover the surface and keep all chopped veggies under the surface of the juice.. ah i see, ty for advice Np, cheers mate.. Yea, just throw it away and even if a little bit of mold stay in the jar it's ok yes, i think i heard it from aajonus it digests with cooked meat tho",10,220

Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches.. elevator buttons, etc... Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door.. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances.. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard.. Use your elbow only if you have to.. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!. What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing.. This means that the air will not infect you!. BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious.. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon.. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!).. This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific.. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.. 3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family).. The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges.. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx.. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms beginning.. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx.. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be.. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it.. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus.. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved.. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us.. Only symptomatic support is available.I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic.. You are welcome to share this email..

3783,"What is a stomach flu?. Yaaaas #INFLUENZA, (#FLU): This is mainly a viral detoxification of the respiratory, intestinal and/or lymphatic systems, like cleaning the carbon from a car’s engine.. Influenza flushes the body of many accessible stored toxins and allows for a fresher, cleaner-running body.. Rejoice and see them through.. Increased vitality follows if flu are not stopped with drugs and a healthful diet is eaten that helps the flu process.. Viruses are not living organisms.. They are solvents manufactured within cells.. They do not self- replicate as believed.. Viruses are body soaps.. They cleanse contaminated cells, or parts of cells, from the body.. When damaged, decaying or dead cells are so polluted that microbes, such as bacteria, parasites and fungi, cannot eat and eliminate the contaminated damaged, decaying or dead tissue, cells manufacture viruses (solvents) to dissolve and dilute the chemically contaminated waste for elimination through mucous membranes, skin, tear ducts, ear wax, gums and tongue.. I reiterate, when damaged, decaying and dead cells are too toxic from chemical pollution (from shampoos, cosmetics, medication,  preservatives and pesticides in food, processed foods, and pollution of water, air and land), bacteria and fungi cannot survive to eat and discard those contaminated damaged, decaying and dead cells.. The body almost exclusively uses viruses (solvents) to dissolve, and hopefully neutralize and eliminate those contaminated damaged, decaying and dead cells.. Science knows that viruses are NOT living organisms.. They cannot reproduce so, the belief that they self-replicate is preposterous.. Cells manufacture viruses.. Viruses are solvents.. Saying that viruses self-replicate is the same as saying soap self- replicates.. Eating plenty of smoothies all day long for as long as flu endures facilitates that detoxification process..

Not hungover lol, search parasites and maybe it'll come up.. Brandon 🇬🇧 I think Aajonus is incorrectly referring to “IBS” in the video above instead of IBD (Crohn’s/UC).. I’m pretty sure the research of Dr Weinstock centered around IBD (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3744107/).. For Aajonus to confuse it with IBS is not only incorrect but also weakens his own argument, since IBS is the less severe condition of the two.. Kinda disappointing to see AV make a mistake like that, but if I’m missing something let me know.. The next thing you show them should probably be based on how they react btw, so let us know how it goes.. Some people just won't accept it though, and being persistent will just annoy them, better to leave them be if this happens after a few things you show them.. Everyone is on their own path.. Anyway good luck.. You can just search for it and find it easily Yeah the studies are for Crohn’s, and not for IBS, but in the clip he refers to IBS and describes IBS symptoms.. I’m gonna cut him some slack because that was in the middle of a 5 hour lecture.. I've heard him refer to a study using trichinosis for Crohn's before, either way helminthic therapy is a good way to start breaking the brainwashing people have today to fear parasites, bacteria etc For sure, I appreciate the suggestion, and i’ll use it.. In this article he correctly refers to Weinstock’s research as targeting Crohn’s: https://aajonus.online/articles/pdn14_microbes so I think he just got the two confused during his lecture https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian",16,292

By taking action and moving to any direction you'll be able to correct the course.. People will never take action if they don't know what to take action against Then be a leader for them.. Also you need one person to start, and hope people follow.. That's just human behaviour.. Haha same train of thought I myself don't know what I can do against the system..

Be friendly, human relationship is one the most important asset you can have :) 👍🏻 👍👍👍 This seems more and more probable than ever, as it's based on economic models.. And we're experiencing the economic crash currently When the bubbles start popping America will be no more What's the consensus on here about the coronavirus?. Is itA) hoaxB) Depopulation ConspiracyC) excuse for crashing the economyD) Genuine bat soup plagueE) Man made virus that escapedF) mass detox Smokescreen to 1) Hide agricultural losses that will keep intensifying due to extreme weather events caused by multidecadal and hundred year natural cycles converging now- Government curfew on Corona will hurt a lot of agricultural producers too2) Controlled economic recession and crash to switch to a fully traceable new digital currency 3) Tightening of government grip and censorship on its citizensBasically, advancement of Agenda 21 & 2030 goals.. We can know what is going on, and knowing it sets us free to do what we want about it.. Knowing the reasons for all this may be harder since is it done out of love or hate, do they want to depopulate and weaken majority because they love the few and create a better human race out of those who see behind the curtains or because they generally despise all of us.. Unless your body is using that cholesterol for healing or other processes and there isn't much left for tanning.. Egg yolks are rich in cholesterol, so are testicles if you can get them.. its like any other illness, they are just testing for some particular proteins which if the test results positive they call it ""covid-19"".. no more people are dying than normal flu/cold season (call it whatever you want).. illness is a healing period, and going to hospital and putting antibiotics and other drugs into you is unhealthy and sometimes results in death.. also no good food in hospitals so recovery is hard once you are there.. its a continuation of the minsunderstaing of the germ theory and medical debacle.. Same thing as aids, ebola, whatever.. Dehumanization campaign not a word has been said about vegetable oils, lack of nutrition, stres,  whatever, only ""covid-19"".. when i talk to normies at work and see how everything is looking, it seems to me like people just dont want to understand/get deeper into it.. some people must die, and thats the truth of it.. i think thats how normies look at it, unconciously.. its a game.. the strongest survive, those who know how to eat, how to rest, how to avoid hospitals.. those with less skills like that, beliveve the whole thing, just like many did with aids, and they get sick and die.. its looking to me more and more like a human-human game.. no one really wants to help these people.. because deep down we know, death is natural and there cannot be too many of us.. also the rest/reset period for the working normies is useful.. an economic depression is not a bad thing, its just a decrease in economic activity that is sometimes needed.. just as day needs night.. and the media got on it in such a weird and massive way, becuase they were losing importance.. Young people only watch Youtube and snapchat or instagram, or whatever, not TV and not news site anymore.. Now the media made such a big stupid deal out of it, that the politicians and young people and people in general had to start watching the news or reading news sites.. Truth is, maybe the normies are more woke than us.. We are so scared of sickness and death that we cling to WE (ego) WANT (desire) TO LIVE (control of life.. They just go around having fun, pretending like death is nothing, making Global games such as this covid-19 with no regard to human life, economy, health, anything like that.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J60fQr0GWo People watch this mass extermination camps, and applaud the doctors doing this.. Not a word is said about vegetebale oils, a nice bed with a cosy fireplace to rest and heal.\ I don't think there is any agenda here behind hidden actors, Illuminati, the Elites or whatever.. We are doing this to ourselves, willingly and everyone knows about it.. I just tell my scared coworkers that sugar inhibits the immune system and sunlight helps.. Movie reccomendation: Contagion (2011).. It's the coronavirus movie!. Disagree.""What the human race is suffering from is mass hypnosis..

We comply to this system unconsciously because we're born into slavery.. Normies are still in Plato's cave You may say it's easy to see what's going on, but there are always different takes.. And the reason is because we don't know exactly what's going on, and we may never know the reasoning for these events etc..

Francis Marion Pottenger, Jr., a physician in Monrovia, California, opened the Pottenger Sanatorium Clinic with his two brothers, specializing in tuberculosis (TB).. He hypothesized that tuberculosis was caused by deficiencies in the adrenal gland and, to test the hypothesis, he experimented with cats.. Pottenger fed cats both cooked and raw meat.. To his astonishment, he observed very different health outcomes.. Out of curiosity, Pottenger began a ten-year study focused on variations in the diets of cats.. The variables in his experiments included either raw milk versus cooked or raw meat versus cooked.. Throughout the entire study and four generations of cats, Pottenger diligently recorded his observations of the health, weight, calcium and phosphorus levels, skeletal structures, and dispositions of the cats.. The differences were quite striking.. (Pottenger)In short, the cats subsisting on the raw products (in the first experiment raw meat and in the second experiment raw milk), maintained excellent health.. Mother cats carried their babies to full-term, birthed approximately five kittens to a litter, and experienced no difficulty in nursing.. The kittens had consistent skeletal structure and no dental issues or infections.. Conversely, the health of cats fed cooked meat and cooked milk quickly declined.. Even within three months of a transition from a raw to cooked diet, dental infections often arose.. Mother cats had difficulty carrying offspring full-term, and suffered from increased miscarriages and raised infant mortality rates.. Mother cats were often too weak to nurse, and some died in labor.. Kittens were born with varying skeletal structures and weaker bones, and were prone to infections, allergies, and respiratory illnesses.The degenerative health of the cats on cooked meat/cooked milk diets continued and appeared to be passed from generation to generation.. After several generations of degeneration, Pottenger attempted to test the potential “regeneration” of health by means of replacing a cooked diet with a raw one.. He found that this was indeed possible, though minor health problems did persist even into the third generation..

Like today morning 2 short and deep hurting strikes to my heart.. I wonder why, could there be lot of toxins moved into my fat tissues.I don't have any history of heart problems, today in this morning they seemed noticable.. I have had small strikes like that before in last few weeks but these seemed like something is going on.. Grandfather (mothers father) had died suddenly out of heart attack at age 24.. He was lumberjack, dairy/horse farmer, at one points of his life he was fat with a huge belly and later he had lost weight and soon gotten randomly the heart attack and died.I have been doing raw carnivore/primal since 2018 spring.I drink green juice almost every morning.Daily consumption: raw milk, beef muscle, organs and fat, eggs, unsalted cheese, raw unheated yogurt, wild lake fish, honey, tomatoes.. And occasionally I have some carrot juice, cream and butter for formulas.Last two weeks I have been doing cheese trains everyday.. Antón López-Leitón VeigaAntón López-Leitón Veiga I had 3 pains on my chest on my primal.. 2 or them lasted for 1 week and another 1 for 3 weeks.. When it ended, i felt much much better.. Better breathing, less asthma.I was not doing hot baths in that time.. If it were now, I would do them.. 3 hours a day.. And just threw up Do you have a video on how to do raw cheese?For an italian that is having heavy headaches Sounds delicious and long term - a lot of raw sour cream with fruit to detox brain what fixed my headaches is mineral water with lemon and honey Weed just makes me depressed and paranoid.. While I’m smoking I just feel really down in the dumps.. that’s so that the animal testing shows that it is safe.. But that is the norm we know It actually said that vaccines for humans were full of contaminants but the vaccine for animal use was clean.. They treat us worse than animals Is a milder form so the bodies can get used to it When I'm not fasting, I'm also flooding my body with nutrients, minerals.. My body would become thin definitely, as the reserves are drawn upon.. But primal dieters have strong reserves, and can bounce back fast after the fast.. Our physical body is enveloped and maintained by an etheric body, and fasting effects changes at that level.. So yes, it may not make sense at the physical level, but there are things at other levels beyond the physical that we are not aware of that can change.. When our bodies are clean of pollutants and we do not have any toxicity left.. Then",26,475
3855,"What do you mean ""find raw kefir"" ?. It may not work for everyone.. I couldn't get fasting to work long ago.. But as I grew older and embraced spirituality, fasting worked well.. So there's something beyond the physical at work here.. Buy Organic eggs and eat alot raw (15-20 a day).. You can buy kefir grains to ferment the milk or add raw honey to it and let it sit for 2-3 hours in room temp.. If you drink 2 -3 liters of milk a day with some beef fat  then you don't really need butter that much.. Beef fat > butter imo Here is some recommendations what you can eat haku bro you received so much good advice already.. I had headaches all my life.. Had amalgam fillings in all my large teeth, poor diet usually, many vaccines.. My head has been detoxing a lot on raw primal.. I don't get headaches anymore.. I've been eating raw sour cream like crazy the last year - sometimes up to 5-7L per week.. With honey and fruit and naturally sparkling mineral water.. Raw fatty fish also one of my favourites.. Plus sleeping when sleepy and warm baths when you feel like it Horrid All kefir grains are bs.. If you add kefir grains to milk, it will ferment, but you won't have any probiotics because such bacterial cultures are opportunistic (they break food and feed only themselves instead of feeding human body).. Here you can find abit of info about it.. I supressed that part because i can only find raw kefir :P .. You could starve more get unbearable headaches and learn that fasting is not good.When the body has no fats to encase toxins they start to cause damage and pain.. Or maybe you could find good pork Well for me it was vice versa, only if i would supply my body enough fats,minerals, vitamins and enzymes the massive pain would disappear and i would go  back to sleep.. I don't understand how forcing your body to eat it self is beneficial especially with all the pollution around.. When you would fast your body was thin, or fat, or in the middle ?. You are forcing your body to use its emergency storage.. Hehe, look whos here, familiar face ;) Just eat raw, like veg juices, milk, or meat.. No cooked food as it clogs you up straight after a fast.. Aajonus advocated losing weight rapidly instead of fasting.. Yes the weight gain and weight loss cycle works too, at the physical level to remove toxins.. But total lack of food causes some meta level of change in the body.. In spite of fasting, i woukd do an egg fast I live in Amsterdam and you can only buy raw kefir in stores not raw milk.. You'll have to go to farms to buy raw milk And it gets easier and easier as you go by, Sometimes my appetite is not that great or really no appetite at all so i just drink some milk with honey and eggs.. That is equivalent of fasting for me.. Sorry that was meant for haku 144 Members haha You start eating yourself and you feel good temporarily while body has a lot more job to do.My experience with fasting is just negative.. I lose a lot of clarity.. The whole think why i went and tried fasting in the first place was because i did not like eating.. I used to never eat breakfast too.. And the amount i ate was little I am familiar with Aajonus' view.. It was only when I got so sick that I had to try fasting, and it certainly helped me alot.. Raw alone can be too slow if you have serious problems.. At least for me.. How did it help you ?. I see some part of people suggesting to fast too in other websites.. I am certainty not going to force myself to starve.. As i lose a lot of things when i do not eat.I had big teeth problems and if i starved i would have lost the teeth, because i was recommended to fast, but i followed Aajonus advice and it worked You should not fast in the first place There were many occasions.. I have a penchant for getting into trouble.. I had an electrocution problem where my nerves were on fire and I could sleep only every few days.. Raw did not help.. Lack of regenerative sleep slowly eats away at you.. I had to solve the problem fast and only fasting worked.",50,764
3856,"Follow Jesus, i'm out I used to make kefir with raw milk and kefir grains , but i found a cow that has normal bacterial flora and now the milk just ferments on its own and it is like kefir but better.. And i do not have to do anything i assure you its raw ""I live in Amsterdam and you can only buy raw kefir in stores"" If you eat ""raw kefir"" from stores, you'll hurt yourself by spreading opportunistic bacterial cultures and depopulating your probiotic gut flora.. Pretty much everything commercial available product which is called ""kefir"" or ""yoghurt"" (no matter if it is raw/organic/natural etc) it's not a probiotic, it's a fraud.""You'll have to go to farms to buy raw milk"" Yea, exactly!. Raw milk is a probiotic.. And if you buy raw milk from farm and then add some kefir grains to it, you'll destroy that milk.. It won't be a probiotic anylonger.. I respect Aajonus alot and knew the man, but I think fasting is something that works well in conjunction with raw, from experience.. There was no milk or honey there though,  sorry Brando It was pretty lit and it's made me cry I traveled to my spiritual sanctuary Just drinking milk and honey like always Sup Sup Sup Sup Peterson Farm Bros.. get dairies rockin' with 'We Will Milk Cows' | AGDAILYhttps://www.agdaily.com/video/peterson-farm-brothers-we-will-milk-cows-parody/ 11kg the first 3 weeks Milkshakes helped me in the last ones That’s a lot Wait that’s kg lol I only gained 10 :-( My goal is to put on another 20 pounds within the next year of so.. I eat supermarket eggs and grain fed beef.. All raw.. For 15 months.. And feel better each day.Gained 25kg Then the cows get more problems, the farmers hire doctors to fix them, the cows stop showing symptoms but get sicker, .... Vicious cycle A lot of farmers are at war with bacteria But it will still be raw and have many good fats and minerals Yeah its good for health but not optimal for digestion Every cow has normal bacterial flora.. If you milk a cow, put that milk in a warm and dark place to ferment (without adding anything to it, no honey, no saliva etc, nothing) and if that milk won't ferment, it means that the cow is sick.. You can't have ""raw kefir"" from store, because they add kefir grains to make it and you can't add kefir grains to raw milk, because it will putrefy.. They heat up milk to kill natural bacteria and then they add kefir grains.. There is that, or they don't use grains at all and just add bacterial culture.. Still there should be regulations on when you can call it raw That sucks Yeah i would do that to but to much hassle going out to the countryside.. this is from the bottle ""we process milk from grass-fed cows.. Not heated, homogenised or skimmed.. Straight from the cow, the milk is safely fermented for 24 hours using a kefir culture"" I know about that commercial kefir/joghurt grains fraud from some time now, but when i found out about it, my jaw just dropped and i couldn't belive that the ""food hoaks"" is so deep.. When milk is cooled to too low temperature it wont fermented or it takes weeks.. At least it was for me when i used to buy milk from farmers who have the equipment to cool it, also they use some sort of chemicals to clean the ducts where milk flows www.rawmilkcompany.nl this isthe company Cooked eggs with fruit.🙈🙈🙈Let your body rest a little Cooked food stress your body.. Fruit is Detox.. Mixing them is poison And that's the point my friend, they do it because there is no regulations that will strictly forbid it.Also i don't believe that any store let raw milk to ferment with natural bacteria and then put it to the bottle and sell as a ""kefir"", because natural milk always ferments in different way.. In spring consistency and smell/taste of naturally fermented milk will be abit different then the consistency and smell/taste of milk from the same cow in autumn (Kefirs from store are always the same).. Also cows get sometimes sick (they eat some poisonous plant etc) and the milk won't ferment at all, so i can't imagine any store/milk company letting milk ferment with natural bacteria and then pour everything out if it won't ferment.. I have few trusted farmers from which i buy milk and even in winter when i go for the milk and it's like below zero outside and cows are fed with hay, when i put that milk in cups in room temperature the milk ferments after 2-3 days all the time.. In summer good milk can ferment even after few hours.Also they use some sort of chemicals to clean the ducts where milk flows This is a point.. Milk from farmer will rarely ferment, if he uses this, because: 1.. They clean machinery with some chemicals that can harm bacteria 2.. Milking machines hurts udder and making inflammatory condition and changing bacterial flora.Tbh farmers should not even wipe the udder with a cloth.. +1 👆🏻 It deprives the physical body of nutrients, but you can last a while.. And in the meantime you clear out your etheric body, and you bounce back much stronger after the fast, especially if you are eating all raw.. Lots of cream and honey.. Also try cream-butter-honey suppisitoriers.. Do lymph baths or hold hot water bottles to your head, they bring more nutrients to your head Fasting is starvation Sleep is the best relief also for head and brain, allowing fluid to exchange with body and brain True, dryfasting is a very powerful self-inflicted detox Lymph baths and hot water bottle improve lymphatic congestion making your brain swell and put more nutrients there Dry fast will speed up the detox without protection.. I would do antifasting: a lot of little meals a day Cream-butter-honey suppisitoriers feed nervous system and brain Cream feeds nervous system and brain There is also one thing with freezers that they poorly mimics natural way of freezing (freezers freeze to quickly).. If i had to freeze some larger food supplies, i'd first let them cool in fridge and then put in turned off freezer and start freezing.. 🙌 David got it Freezing damages No..

It freezes better than meat according to Aajonus I wanted to ask about it raw milk, especially how do you guys store 🤔 nothing that i've read talks about frozen butter but mainly freezing was discussed in context of raw meat Ah Kays but i'm going away from optimal for the moment it isnt I thought freezing isn’t recommended for primal does it ""regain"" its qualities if left out after?. like eggs regain the enzymes when left out of the fridge is freezing raw butter *okay* Awesome,  much love to my Primal family Works for me too Aajonus has talked on the effects of freezing on butter.. The healing effects went to 1/5(?) 3tbsp cream and butter (also coconut cream if available)And a quarter teaspoon of honey does it ""regain"" some of the healing effects Yes, it feeds brain and nervous system",6,158

After few months of eating like that, you'll feel yourself better.. haku if you don't know what to eat, just eat raw foods that you want.. as much raw fat as you can, like butter with honey.. like I have green bowel when I eat cucumbers but then I stop eating it and my bowel comes back normal Human bowel should be solid brown or brownish color other colors maybe because foods or illnesses.. yes sure, The liver is damaged because of lots of factors..

3866,"Oh man that is a revelation for me as I am doing kefir with the grains donated by other people.. Prior to that I tried to ferment milk with nothing, honey, spit etc but it wasn’t having that creamy texture and was less tasty.How does Aajonus know that there is opportunistic bacteria in kefir and what the heck happens when we drink kefir with grains?. It is just milk who ferments on its own, good quality milk does that when it is not chilled to too low of a temperature You mean that we got lactic-acid-producing bacteria in our saliva ?. Lol, cmon man be serious, don't mix things.. Adding saliva to milk weakens fermenting abilities of natural bacterias that are already in milk.. Sometimes milk will ferment, but the biochemistry of this process resembles that of Boris Bolotov and his famous whey/cream + Greater Celandine kvas (in other words its survival of the fittest bacteria ;) Btw, i noticed this ""spitting"" thing popped up after Vladimir Megres ""Anastasia"" books..

When you're detoxing, cheese can also be used Yeah could be.. Moreover sparkling water + tons of lemons + tons of honey is amazing, like Fanta v2.0 You could add some acv too Bullshit.. You need to cath up to Aajonus work first before commenting Amazing video Aajonus said that sometimes parasites will kill you if you are extremely toxic because parasites and larvae feed on decaying tissues.... so because most toxins are stored in the brain, they can eat your brain up..

3867,"Have you read the books ?. Bacteria are your friends; Parasites are your friends; Viruses are your friends.. If you don't have them, you will be depressed.. They help you get well.. They break down degenerative tissue.As I keep repeating, there are three ways to cleanse the body.The solvent process means that the body uses 80% fats; 15% protein; 5% alcohol - made from the carbohydrate you consume - fermented in the digestive tract.. These are solvents, just like the solvent degreasers we have, solvents that dissolve matter.. Our bodies do the same.. It is a very slow process.. The by-product of it is almost identical to turpentine and it is as toxic as turpentine, so it creates a slight nausea.The next way to detoxify the system are viruses and bacteria.. Viruses and bacteria penetrate and work quickly - two and a half times faster than the solvent process and 50% less toxic.. So if you have a cold or flu - viral pneumonia or the like - you will be taken out of service ..... You have a flu or a cold and it knocks you out.. You can see that they are tired and it works quickly.. And as I said: it is 50% less toxic than the solvent process.The third is wonderful: parasites.. You work five times faster than your body uses a solvent.. You can eat degenerative tissue very quickly.. The excrement - the by-products of parasites - is five times less toxic than the solvent process or 100% less toxic.. Of course, that depends on what you see - the excrement or the by-product.Q: Rapid clarification of the solvent process.A: 80% fat; 15% protein; 5% alcohol.Q: And where does that mainly take place - on the whole body?A: Well, your body will mainly make the element in the liver or lymph because the lymph nourishes the whole body.. Very little is fed into the bloodstream.. The blood mainly transports oxygen to the body.. The lymphatic system absorbs the nutrients from the lactal system in the digestive tract and in the liver and sends the nutrients throughout the body.. It also collects toxicity, holds it in the nodes or glands, disassembles it and sends it to one of our many intestines.. We all work like a big asshole.. Our skin, our eyes, our lacrimal passages, the ear passages, the nostrils, the neck, the stomach, the skin, the large intestine, the anus, the urinary tract and, in women, the uterus, the vaginal cavity, constantly release mucus.. This is how we detoxify.. Women can detoxify more than men, about 20% more and they also have a 20% longer lifespan than men.All I wanted to convey was that you have to be patient to get well.. Magic balls don't work.. They cost a lot of money and make you healthier.. The most dangerous alternative therapy I've seen is colloidal silver and liquid minerals - the most toxic substances I've ever seen.. It pulls the metals out of the body, the tissues and buries them in the blood, bone marrow and lymph.. It doesn't cut them out of the body.. You usually need a liter of cream a day if you only had a tablespoon of liquid minerals.. You would need a liter of raw cream a day to get rid of that amount of mineral toxicity.. Once you dehydrate it, dry it, it becomes plant food again.. So it's no longer food.. It's ground-bound again.. Feeding plants is good because they are broken down there.. They mine soil-based minerals.. Once an item - I don't care if it comes from food - comes from the food source and is dehydrated, it is no longer bioactive.. It is no longer bioenergetic.. Your body can no longer use it.. If you root yourself in the ground and never move and want to spend your whole life decomposing these very difficult substances into biological forms, you will become a plant in your next life.. But in this case you are human and it doesn't work.Q: Chelation therapy.A: Chelation therapy uses toxic minerals to extract other toxic minerals.. It just collects more toxic minerals in the body.. My patients, who were cardiac patients who received chelation therapy, are the most poisoned people I have ever seen.. It is terrible.. Your skin becomes very thin, red, red and tears easily - just like with aspirin.. When a person takes a lot of aspirin.. It makes the ski n look like toilet paper.. It is very tiring for the body.",50,755

Perhaps you can search for the keywords or enter all of the text.. Yes fuck!. I used colloidal silver in my vegan days.. Micro minerals too.. I am super toxic..

If you cook high meat, you will get violently ill.. Cooking meat changes the chemistry of the meat and no longer allows it to successfully assimilate through the body.By heating the food, you are now altering the bacteria and making it dangerous to consume Tribes who ate cooked meat still had a few health problems..

So you just join this group, write to a person in your area and ask to give you some grains which look like the picture I posted earlier.. They also form long structures becoming not like grains but 10cm long soft thing Dominiq 🇵🇱  Interesting take Raw unheated honey Part 3/3O.k.. So whats the point with disinformation in it ?. Well there is a clear difference between natural so called ""opportunistic"" bacteria and artificial (lab made) ""opportunistic bacteria"" that e.g.. lab technicians talk about (AV was talking about these lab made grains).. There is clearly some cover-up going on atm, coz many HMP researchers don't want to use official scientific terminology, its obvious that they smell smthing fishy.. Natural ""opportunistic"" bacteria tbh never are opportunistic, because they always join probiotics or pathogens (so they never remain in neutral, opportunistic state).. On the other hand lab made bacteria should be at least called ""quasi opportunistic"", but i think ""artificial/unnatural/gmo/mutated"" names are more adequate.. These lab made ""opportunistic"" bacteria always stay in neutral, opportunistic state and never join probiotics or pathogens (so they never feed/maintain or harm the body).This is my overview: If its true, that lab-made bacteria in commercial kefirs, yoghourts etc & also all commercial kefir bacteria grains etc were mutated (gmo-ed) in order to stay all the time in neutral/opportunistic state, this can cause a situation that even if ppl eat raw meat & egg, they will starve, because of lab-made ""selfish"" bacteria settled their digestive tract and feed only themselves instead of feeding the body.There are many holes in my thinking (e.g.. natural bacteria are always stronger then lab-made and it's hard to belive that artificial bacteria would crowd out natural bacteria and settle intestines), but the agenda is ubiquitous, they fight natural bacteria wherever they can (especially now, they even decontaminate whole urban areas with trucks spraying chemicals).Maybe they want to make meat eaters look like vegans (they introduce all these 3D and gmo meats etc).. Average meat/dairy eater isn't so informed like e.g.. ppl in this grp.. For normies ""meat"" and ""dairy"" its all they can get in store.... Part 2/3My info are based mostly on professionals working in labs, food companys and MDs, they don't write any papers, but i also found few pioneer researchers who publish this knowledge.. Unfortunately most of the work i found is in polish language, but i'll translate some of it here.One of these researchers is Józef Krop and here he explains what ""opportunistic"" bacteria means (brief translation: ""So far it's been established that so called useful bacteria is 5%, pathogenic bacteria is also 5%, but the largest group, which is least studied, its so called opportunistic or facultative bacteria.. It turns out, what we already know, that opportunistic bacteria join either to useful bacteria or to pathogenic bacteria.. If a person doesn't stress to much, eat healthy organic food, doesn't get poisoned with personal hygiene products or home cleaning products etc, then opportunistic bacteria will join probiotic bacteria and such person will be healthy.. If a person makes by himself or finds himself in reversed environmental conditions, especially when it comes to food, opportunistic bacteria will change their direction and join psthogenic bacteria and the person will be sick"").He doesn't like to use term ""opportunistic bacteria"" by himself (here he points it out, brief translation: ""Now i'll tell you a little bit about pathogenic bacteria, useful bacteria and so called, but i don't like this word, opportunistic bacteria.. They simply are, these opportunistic 90% bacteria, very cleaver bacteria and according to how we behave, what we eat, according to where we work, we will have either well functioning useful bacteria or well functioning pathogenic bacteria and these opportunistic, in turn, will join useful or pathogenic bacteria"").. So that term is smthing officially imposed in exoteric research and authors (or rather whistleblowers ?) often highlight that they don't agree with such terminology.It is also worth mentioning that Krop classifies E.. coli as probiotic bacteria (here he gives few examples: probiotic bacteria are Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and pathogenic are Staphyloccocus, Cornyebacterium, Propionibacterium).. Part 1/3First of all the term ""opportunistic bacteria"" was promoted few years ago as a result of so called ""The Human Microbiome Project"" (HMP).. Many lab technicians, process/manufacturing directors, MDs etc.. that i talked with use this term commonly, but in my opinion there is abit of disinformation in it (i'll talk about it in part 3).When AV did that ""school of life"" vid, it was before HMP, so he didn't use word ""opportunistic"", but clearly used the definition just like lab technicians and MDs tolk to me now (""bacteria breaking food to feed itself but not feed the human body"").. HMP took place in 2007-2013, but it was only for public view and i bet that classified research had been done years before, so i guess AV got that leaked info from some professionals working on it (i didn't notice him giving source of his information about it)..

I also tried other molds (on fruits and pig fat) ofc everything was raw and i fruits wasn't from shop, and i only felt abit sleepy after pigs fat mold.. /feels /feels /tryagainsweety This is good point, because fermentation is an anaerobic process and mold grows only in aerobic condition.. When i do high milk i never mix it and the milk ferments well without air and on top i got thick mold layer.. Veggies, like sauerkraut, should be fermented in anaerobic conditions other way they start to mold.So i was wondering why AV told to air it.. I remember from my childhood, that gypsies were doing high meat by burying meat in the ground (so they didn't air them).. Same thing was with tribes from which AV learned about high meat, they also buried meat in the ground.. AV said that he airs meat to ""keep the bacteria working"" so he basically kept anaerobic conditions and every 2-3 days he just ""kicked"" them with abit of air.. There is still oxygen in ground , eskimos bury it covering the top with sticks and leaves so the oxygen still managed to reach the meat.. Not like in a jar for example where when oxygen gets used up that is it.. these links haku posted really are good everyone should watch Also our gut has oxygen and maybe eskimos and other tribes who let the meat rot mimicked our gut really well.. Also burying it in ground protects from freezing.. https://youtu.be/WQ1AyX0RyQM Everyone should follow a strictly plant based animal cruelty free, vegan diet.. If you die, then you die, so what....These are only physical bodies.. If you want to transcend out of these carbon based meat packs and become a spirit being of light by raising your vibrational frequency through a chakra alignment.... then start eating your plants!. You will experience a kundalini awakening and have an ego death which leads you to the realization that you should only be doing lemon detox fasts and drinking turpentine.. Go vegan!. /feels /feels nice links Dorus thinks its super detoximg method and only way to make real highmeat lol /feels Lol i just clicked /feels link ;) /feels /feels",24,511

3879,"Where has sv3rige suggested no air no fridge?. In any case, the bacterial development won't progress.. Usually in fridge the weeks 2-3 are to be avoided since ingesting that high meat can cause a lot of detox.. More isolation tomorrow in Spain!Only ""essential"" works By you, haku, not progressing the bacterial development daily you might've ingested some of that bacteria that develops during weeks 2-3, creating a strong detox effect.. No air slows down the fermentation, in my opinion Don't force yourself.. Keep progressing slowly.. Give plenty of time to your body to build up a healthy base Baby steps Yeah the bacterial process stops, and then mold becomes present.. /feels That's why fridge high meat is suggested to be eaten after 4 weeks if I remember correctly /feels The guy who has is ex primal diet that's now raw vegetarian and takes protein powder U kidding me ?. If I'd told my farmer ""go read a book"" i pretty much wouldn't have any milk from any farmer from that village ;) Makes you wonder were all the people are who were saved and healed by Aajonus.. I hope they won't let Aajonus legacy die.. I would ride my bicycle around too and would go talk with them , i would tell them that i eat raw meat and raw eggs and if the folk were older they often told me their father ate raw eggs too 🤔🤔🤔 Yea, that's why you keep it in warmth room temperature.. https://synergisticuniverse.com/aajonus-vonderplanitz-videos Older folks yes but younger ones might read it , if i would do it then i would send them anonymous email not related to me Same here, but after a little bit of searching you can find few.. These are the people I target first when i go to the village 😁 There was this one exvegan in sv3rige talk who had been vegan for 20 years and just kept going back to veganism then again to primal then again to veganism over and over until the lesson was learned.. I have an earthing mat, on which I sleep.. It is protection against 5G, but also against any other radiation.. It is from TerraPro.. The website is in german, but you can have it translated into English (on the website or by google).. Ah here I have access to chilled milk only.. Well better than no raw milk at all That is true , honey should help you digest it Yes Thank you also very scelte svelte* thick yet svelte https://www.terrapro.eu/ Don’t do it in parks, there’re hotspots around or electrical wires can be burried underground.. Go to the forest instead.. Trees protect us from emf.. I suffer from emf sensitivity and I do practice forest bathing, it always works when I need a break from the non stop emf assault Wet grass, mud are the best for grounding.. Sure, it’s better than nothig but not in the long run Also i think farmers get brainwashed by the institute of brainwashing in to going to war with bacteria and use chemicals were they don't need toCant confirm tho never asked farmers about it but have seen in some youtube videos on how to ""clean"" milking equipment.Also they place some sort of disinfectant chemical on cows udder too.Still i think not every farmer does it but more and more are going to war You just read in my thought ring now.. Young farmers are like gold these days.. I get warm milk too and it sours in a day.. Here it seems it is required by their dairy contract to keep the milk under 4°C Exactly !. That's what i did after visiting my family and i found a farmer with one of the best milk i've ever tasted, srsly.",27,629
3880,"Unfortunately older folk don't speak English here so i cant give Aajonus books.Maybe there is russian version ?. I would wonder how long it would take to translate Aajonus Books to native language.. Maybe i should give it a try That is painful to watch ☹️ I think you're wrong.. Fermentation is an in-depth studied anaerobic process (means no oxygen is needed).""Not like in a jar for example where when oxygen gets used"" Gets used for what ?. I mean what biochemical reaction would use oxygen in the fermentation process ?""Eskimos bury it covering the top with sticks and leaves so the oxygen still managed to reach the meat"" I don't think they do it to let the oxygen reach the meat.. They do it to let the meat breath (fermentation bacteria excrete their own gases, mostly methane, carbon-dioxide) so if the meat is hermetically sealed, fermentation stops.""Not like in a jar"" Actually jars are one of the best ways to make fermentation if you use airlock valves (e.g.. these in the attached picture).Tbh i think most ppl misunderstood AV when he said ""to air high meat"" and the crux of the matter with AV saying ""to air"" it's not to deliver more oxygene inside the jar, but to:1.. Take the meat out of the fridge and keep it for some time in a room temperature, to make bact eria active again in warm room temperature, 2.. To air the meat by opening the jar and let the pressure (accumulated methane and carbon-dioxide) go away, so the bacteria could breath again.. It's also good to mix the meat so that lower layers could get rid of unnecessary metabolism products (gases)..

He travelled a lot too, met many people He didn't work out, but he did physical labor in his Thailand farm These are my kefir grains I was talking about.. No clue if genuine or lab-made.. BTW those are quite tasty to eat, gummy and salty Notice the unusual formation of the “big guy” I show later in the video These look like some tibetan mushroom grains.. I heard ppl call them ""natural"" but i didn't do any research on them, so i don't know.Tbh i'm to tired after all my research, asking questions and wasting shitloads of my time checking everything whether it's natural or lab-made... So i decided to cut corners and this is what i do:1.. I don't buy any dairy neither from a store nor from a milk vending machine.. I go to the village and ask locals who sells dairy,2.. If i find some minor farmer with no more then 2-3 cows that are beeing grass fed and in winter hay fed instead of compound fed, i ask him if he's using a milking machine and if cow udders got some inflammation.. If he uses milking machine i don't buy from him and if cows udder got some inflammation i ask why (because sometimes they feed cows with rbGH without telling about it ..) and usually dude gets upset, so i leave him and keep looking,2.. After i find some honest farmer, i do my last test: i just pour the milk into glasses, put them in some warm and dark place and w8 for it to ferment.. If after fermentation i got a good quality high milk, i finally have my secure source of dairy.. That's a very good method.. Here in Finland the care that is given to the cows is superb so even a cow that is in milking machine and the milk goes to a chilling tank, the milk is good quality milk It's extremely rare to find a person who milks cows by hand today in Finland.. Chilled milk doesn't ferment that fast.. Here people who have a few cows cant afford milking machines so they use hands Badass.. Aajonus looks incredible and strong af in this video The best milk is not chilled one but it is hard to find here too, i have some old woman who i get my milk from and because it is not chilled it can ferment in a day sometimes.. Also Aajonus sad something about storing milk in not lover then 7 C temperature.Also when they milk the cows some people just use water but some use an acid to wash the tubes it flows and the tank it holds.. My best bet would be to share Aajonus books with them like Aajonus recommends",29,793

They sold coal.. People were burning coal in their homes, cooking with it, heating their homes.. Do you know what’s in coal?. Mercury vapors.. A hundred and ten years of that and what happens to all generations?. You’ve got three generations full of mercury in their lungs..

Also money is gold everything else is credit.. Here you got some literature also in english exclusively dedicated to this natural mechanism of blocking excess fat.. I remember also Francesco Perugini Billi mentioned about it somewhere and also there is one guy in Germany who wrote a whole book about it, i'll write his name when i remind his name.. ""No one here would ever eat that much fat in the first place"" Hm, i eat that much fat every day.- How much ?. As much as i possible can before i vomit it or have diarrhea.- What amount is it ?. In my case it's ~0,33 pounds per meal, impossible for me to eat more.- Do i vomit when i eat more ?. Yes- Why do i eat that much fat ?. Coz it's the best food on earth !- Do i eat also meat to some limit ?. There is no limit for meat, i can eat one rib eye a meal, two or more and don't have any diarrhea or vomit.- Do i eat also raw carbs to some limit (e.g.. sugary fruits) ?. There is no limit, you can eat 2 kg per meal and you won't vomit or have diarrhea, but after a week eating like that you'll have fatty liver for sure.. But this goes for everything if you go against your body.. No one here would ever eat that much fat in the first place.. This would be so rare not even worth mentioning.. You would have to be mentally ill to do it in the first place.And would not have diarrhoea or vomit, your body would just pass it semi digested.. You could easily see it from the stool.. It is not even worth talking about it.. Body loses a lot of nutrients when it vomits or has diarrhoea it would not do it if it doesn't have to.. I am sorry but all i see is desperation to prove your case.. Don't try to buy your way out by turning this around ;) There is no known disease caused by eating excess fat, why ?. Because you can't eat excess fat.. Why you can't eat excess fat ?. Because there is a natural blocking mechanism that will cause you to diarrhea or vomit.. You can eat only as much fat as your body can handle at a time.. If you eat 0,01 pound above this limit, you'll have instant nausea and then diarrhea or vomit.",29,505

Some of the research is public , i shared some on raw church channel 😂😂 In his books, and he talked about them There is a line between a fact and a theory, if you come up with a theory you have to prove it first to be viable as a proof..

However I'm 17 and i feel like my parents will decide for me And my parents are shit scared and brainwashed, so that would be a disadvantage to me You can always stop the detox with a bath or eating little cooked meat if the symptoms are too bad for your parents and will cause a reaction.. At least tell them to not call a doctor or any authority even if you would have a detox the symptoms should not be that bad for them to stress.. If the parents sell you in fear to authorities then they would be pretty bad parents to endanger their family member.. I am currently eating cooked..

Grandma almost called an ambulance for 37.1 temperature I had 40C° a few times and was brainwashed too to drink drugs to remove it or i would die but on primal diet i was fine without any drugs or anything just food.Probably better idea would be not to tell them about any symptoms you have..

3993,"Hmm talking about aajonus.online?. Np!. It will be hard to understand me... but i'll try.First of all i'm not a supporter of sharing all the knowledge by making it easy accessible for the public (no matter if it's legal or not) because in my opinion it's anti-nature.. It's causing more harm then good to a newbie.. To much light can hurt your eyes.On the other hand i'm a big supporter of sharing knowledge for those who want it.There is a law that allows to make a quotation e.g.. you can cut 3-5 mins of some of AV Q&A and post it on yt legally.. You can name it lets say ""How to cure osteoporosis"" or smthing else eye-catching.. In the description write the source of that ""quotation"" (q&a from a this and that year/month/day etc) and also write a link to this channel.When some1 from yt joins this channel, he becomes our friend.. There is a law that allows you to e.g.. view a copyright protected movie, if you do it by yourself, with friends/family, for your private usage and without sharing it to the public.We know each other in this channel, its easy to send some vid or a book via pm if some one wants it.. The most promising solutions in the space are the block chain based upload services like https://bico.media/.. It lets you interact directly with the Bitcoin SV (the true original Bitcoin protocol) chain and you still own all the data and are fully responsible for it (also meaning you better make sure everything you're doing is above board) I'm using egg yolks to wash my hair wthout the whites https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZFp8ldcTx4 hardy guy for an 81 year old.. as expected and he could improve in some areas like diet since he eats cooked food but just being away from pollution of all kinds does wonders Does anyone know how long raw butter can last before it expires ?.

3998,"Goat's milk and sheep's milk are different though.. Did he ever talk about sheep specifically?. I will try to find exactly what he meant Goats milk is high in hormones especially adrenaline, so someone who is thin and hyperactive should not be drinking goats milk but cows milk.. People who are overweight its fine for them they could use the extra hormones.If you feel hyperactive or anxious don't drink goats milk.. Goats cream wont relax your system cows will.. 20030914LA @ 00:27:56 Hi guys, what do you all do after eating moldy cheese :o Lol I’ll see how it goes tomorrow.. Didn’t eat too much tho.. Only few cubes 😅 hope you feel better soon Mold is a tricky thing, from my pov only ""good"" mold is a mold on a raw food (any raw foods, milk, meat, fruit etc).. If you have so called ""raw"" cheese that was in fact made by heating milk and then adding some bacteria grains into it to start fermentation to make a cheese, i'd be sceptical that eating mold on such cheese is beneficial.. I feel I’m tripping with quiet serious headache (I think something weakened my nerves Also one thing about mold on raw foods: you can feel little bit sleepy after eating it for the first time.. It's also heavy detox, so you can expect ""cold"" or ""flu"" symptoms as well.",11,230

Probably Aajonus’ son.. Jim Ellingson runs the site I think 1.. I DID NOT violate, we talked about what material can be released with the copyright owner himself, he said if i was to put aajonus materials and clips all i had to do is put wewant2live.com as a promotion for the full materials.. As soon I did that my channel got shut down.2.. No I did not get any copyright strikes.3.. I cannot see any copyright strikes in my account, because my account is deleted.. You don't understand, they didn't shut down my youtube, they shut down my whole account.. When i login in youtube with that account all it says is ""you have violated youtube t&c"", well that's pretty ambiguous don't you think?. That's about as much explanation as i was given.4.. By copyright holder i mean a dude who monitors aajonus activity online and copystrikes dropboxes and mega links.. He is one of wewant2live.com owners.5.. He made a claim on videos that i deleted, so they couldn't have shut me down because of the videos i deleted, makes sense?. Anyway as i said in 1.. they did not strike me in the first place, just a quite account shut down.6.. Why do you ask so much questions?. Why do you care?. My whole point was - my account was shut down not because of the copyright, but because youtube decided to quietly delete it with no explanations.. It's almost like you want to push your view of the situation on me.. Well there is no your view in this situation, you are not involved in it.. My final decision was to share it on torrent between members of this group, since i got copyright holder's permission on that.. im working on a much simpler site and materials design currently, it's gonna be more like a library focused on search.. Because he didn't mention shutting down mega link and it wasn't promoted anywhere, unlike dropbox link.. there is a guy named Peo or something, from Finland i think, he runs the site (as in - his hardware and his server).. There are also like 3-5 guys that each have different roles, like copystriking materials online, or writing new materials for the site.",26,480

Yes, that's true, that might of happened.. I'm in direct contact with one of them.. He said youtube ignores them completely.. This was all that i could find.. You mean like scent glands or saliva glands ?. Most of the important stuff is in the brain or in gut somewhere Pancreas , thymus I wanted to see where is the adrenal gland For anyone living in USA this is a good book to have.. It talks the best places to live counting in population density, natural disasters chance, nature, water, forests fires, seasons and rain Did you not read what i wrote?. I DID NOT violate the copyright, copyright holder himself contacted youtube to back off, but they just flipped him off, no explanations.. Same with me, they did not give me any explanations.. You think i got like a mail that said that i had illegal materials they shut down?. Or you think i received a strike when copyright infringement happens?. NO, none of that happened, they just shut down my channel no explanation given.. I am in direct contact with copyright holder and he updates me every several weeks that nothing is working, youtube is just ignoring him..

Asra Conlu, Sv3rige, ""The Natural Human Diet"" and many other, they all are making great content, they all spread the knowledge about AV, they all got thousands views.... So why can't you just make your own content ?. You just put ""raw"" AV vids, violate copyright, don't make any other content and cry when someone claims his legal rights.... ok, have started downloading, will be seeding it",31,563
4016,"Dude FFS !. It is YOU !!. that must do the appeal on the yt channel.. You need to do it in accordance with the yt procedure.But i smell smthing fishy in your statement..

I don't, that's what my post was about.And by not contacting him you mean that i got all this unreleased aajonus info (some of it that is not even on the wewant2live website) from a random stranger?. You just don't believe me when i'm saying that i'm talking to a copyright holder, that's why?. Like i got all these rare books, audios and videos from thin air or something?Stop accusing me of things, if you don't believe me - just stop typing.. I don't care about proving anything to you.. If you don't see a proof under your nose that's your problem.Read the Bible, believe in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, otherwise you will surely burn in hell, and that's not a pleasant thing..

""the prices are kinda big at least for pdf version""   For example Aajonus Questions and Answers – 2nd Edition is 50 bucks.. You can easily buy it for 1$.. How ?. I'll tell you how, just ask 50 ppl e.g.. in this grp if they want to be co-owners of that book.. Make some paypal account for that purpose so ppl could pay you 1$ each with payment title e.g.. ""Payment for purchasing book name (co-ownership)"".. After you gather 50$ just buy it and send to that 50 ppl their pdf copy .... Simple as that.You can go to a bookstore and buy a book by yourself, you can also go to that bookstore with 10 of your friends and you all can pool your money to buy that one book (every one will be co-owner), it's perfectly fine with the law.. ""i guess those aren't books, just pdf files""   O.k.. it's fine, don't have to be books right away.. ""list_of_topics-3.pdf"" you made it by yourself ?. If yes, then chapeau bas, great job (for real, no kidding).. And now tell me how long did you compile that paper ?. A month ?",50,1010
4018,"More ?. So imagine how much time Jim Ellingson spent to compile e.g.. ""Benefits of Eggs and Cheese"" ?. That guy deserves his money !. Ahh yea, ""responded to my post"" but without talking to me, right...""why would i contact Jim?""   Hmm, let me think.... Maybe because he or his organization actually owns the copyrights ?. And using his exclusive copyrights without contacting him can mean theft ?AV didn't work ""for free"".. His son inherited rights after him and got copyright transfers, so he can charge ppl for selling this stuff.. All the knowledge is available for the public and i'll see, maybe he won't mind if ppl that already bought some stuff, shared it in privacy with members of such grps like this.. But you actually need to ask him about it...If you want things ""for free"", i guess vaccines are for free.. No, i didn't say i made them, i said they are not on the site.. You have a serious urge to argue.. I got this gift for free I did already, got 2 books.. Didn't have to steal.. Me neither https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8 yummy yum Indeed Give Jim his money that he deserves, i don't care Yes they are different.. His real name is Jesus or Jesus the Nazarene",16,211
4019,"I didn't talk to you, i just voiced my opinion about copyright and why i chose to do bittorrent (as a response to your post), and also told a part of the story why my channel got deleted.. After that you started to investigate about that story while being not involved in it.I already told you, i DON'T CARE about my channel, why would i contact Jim?. I DO NOT CARE.. Did i stutter?. I'm totally ordering that.. Thanks I'm not talking about this... ""Jesus"" is a symbol of a man, ""Christ"" is a symbol of God Consciousness, ""Jesus Christ"" means a man who became God and also means that God became a man.. That sounds like the teaching of the ascended masters, aka White Lodge, Shambala, Sanat Kumara?. Christ was indeed a part of this very ancient group.. Just type in Google some of these terms together with Christ and you will find how this idea of Christ Consciousness first came about.. And it is different from Jesus the person",11,171
4020,"then why copyright holder himself contacted youtube and they rejected his appeal?. Heresy is easy to google, but the Bible is very hard to understand.Matthew 11:25""At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.""2 Timothy 3:7""Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."" I agree.. That's why I follow Jesus alone.. Just pointing out the source of the Christ Consciousness teaching",4,91

Youtube didn't terminate your account because of copyright violation (copyright owner applied his claim on the basis of copyright).. Youtube terminated your account because of youtube internal law (their policies) violation.""copyright owner said it's ok to post content that i posted afterwards, he allowed me to leave exactly every video that i left on my channel""   Dude, you don't even know who was the person you talked to.... Stop saying ""copyright owner"" over and over without any basis.""it's just none of your business, nor you are helpful to me or anyone""   Oh yeah ?. So why did you start talking to me about this at the first place ?. This is a public channel and you got some dictatorial inclinations ""Only I can speak and no one else"".... p.s.I'll try to contact Jim Ellingson and ask him about this situation, because atm it's only your personal pov.. Like it sounds so random like it was just made up and there is no source to be traced, except those open your third eye buddies.. In no way i questioned it, i just called bs immediately, that's not even a question, that's just spewed out of someone's mouth, makes no sense.. There are people out there who totally buy into it.. To each their own.. There is reasoning behind it but there's also no real need if put faith in Jesus alone I always wondered how do i turn these people away from heresy?. It's like they are purposely blinded to the simplicity of the gospel and they tryna see some beyond of symbolic understanding.. You can't.. Even Jesus couldn't to many of them.. We are all mind programmed to certain extent, being born on this planet under our overlords (plane)t Well yeah Bravo that you questioned it.. It will lead you down another rabbit hole nah, site is private About mega or Dropbox , copyrighted material gets removed instantly by bots, script happened to me too lol that would make it public, but let me pull it so that i can start seeding You mean ""Jesus"", ""Jesus Christ"" or ""Christ"" ?. Because its three different meanings.. If you mean ""The New Testament"", it's also controlled.. Major ""hiding in plain sight"" process seems to happened when they replaced ""Petra"" with ""Peter"".. don’t have to be a public torrent... the torrent file can be accessible only within this group.. Gold is the kings money, silver is the gentleman's money, barter is the poor mans money and debt is for slaves.. Not only, you can also e.g.. inhale them.. They don't make viruses as such, they grow cells in labs and such cells produce viruses.. Such cells can be injected, sprayed, placed somewhere etc Doing this everyone will violate the law, because torrent protocol is designed to share content while downloading it.... Again that socialistic bs.... There isn't anything in nature that is ""for free"".. Money is just a measurement of someones time and effort, there is no money per se.. It's like there is't smthing like height of someone per se, because there must be someone in the first place and after that you can check his height.. It's same thing with the money - there must be someone else's time and effort done first and after that money is just a measurement of such effort.. Saying that ppl should share their work for free it's like saying that ppl should be slaves, it's satanic (antinature) bs.With a legal matter, you need to do your own content first, then you can make a legal quotation.. If you just cut a peace from some larger video protected by copyright, and then you post it somewhere, you don't do any quotation, you just stealing someone else's work piece by piece.. Examples of legal AV quotations are e.g.. in ""The Natural Human Diet"" channel on yt.. Yo ,Could anyone send me a clear picture of all the glands in an animal?(sheep for example)Want to show to my butcher so he can understand what i want GOD BLESS 🙏🏽 I even heard a 32 degree Freemason confirms it.. EVERYTHING IS CONTROLLED EXCEPT JESUS Whoever controls the power grid and the networks also controls digital currency thats the truth whoever owns most of the servers shall be the king He did say that lab grown bacteria could be harmful Miners are incentivized to be honest, no one is more invested in the integrity of the chain than the miners, bitcoin is all about incentives https://medium.com/@craig_10243/bitcoin-is-all-about-incentives-72894518f6b5 That could work, but at least 1 person in this group needs to have all the materials gathered in a legal way (e.g.. buying from ww2live site), after that such person can legally share it with friends/family for so called ""private usage"".. Also pls check the law in your state, because i'm talking about the legal system only in my place.",41,847
4022,"no, users are not in control, server that calculates their data is.. who has more servers, people or the controllers?. man-made viruses are a psyop yeah i mean, he is right abour viruses being solvents, and like dish soap, they are not contagious man-made viruses arent real, thats a redpill but they can only be ""caught"" via injection IIRC, he believed man-made viruses are bad or not real it all I wish Aajonus was around to see if he believes the virus is ""real"" but man-made",3,86
4023,"i DO NOT want blocks to be forever recorded, thats counterproductive for anonymous file sharing, dont you think?. What you think is bitcoin is not bitcoin.. The chain trading under the symbol BTC is a scam, the only true bitcoin is BSV, the true original protocol.. Bitcoin in its original form is incredibly fast and powerful https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/Main_Page and you cant trace where the files came from, from what ip.. meanwhile in bitcoin it is a feature, they literally write every single transaction Ofc you, because you just posted someone else's work that was protected by copyright law without making your own content.. Sv3rige is making his own content (with a lot of AV quotations).. meanwhile torrent is just decentralized files - no one is in control, files are counted, if everyone stops seeding files disappear from the internet because most servers are owned by the higher ups - exactly Bitcoin is controlled by the government if anyone thinks it’s decentralized is asleep 💤 it might be, that’s up to you, bitcoin not anonymous.. It is possible to encrypt data and secure access with bitcoin, see the EHR data project being developed on BitcoinSV, they are literally going to store millions on patient records on-chain, creating one universal database that patients will control: https://ehrdata.com understand.. no such law here unless pressured by media companies from usa.. (e.g.. movies) and its so much faster not even close!. the site is knows to this group only, it's not anywhere public, you can't even google it by searching ""free aajonus materials"" or something similar They can't shut down the whole torrent protocol, but they can track ppl who violate the law and then force legal consequences on you.",12,284

They usually don't send any emails, you can see copyright strikes in your account, in “Videos” dashboard.@followjesus144 ""I am in direct contact with copyright holder""  Who do you mean by copyright holder ?.

He also explained that it's not his site, and that someone else is behind making it.. Moreover AV wasn't doing it for free as well, ppl actually payed him to be able to listen to his knowledge.. No I mean saying controllers are satanists and trannies There is also one thing.. Even if you do a vid with legal quotation on yt, someone can appeal it (yt is just a platform) and the vid might be blocked.. If such situation occurs, you need to make a letter to yt, proving it's not a violation, they will make some investigation (may take even few months ...) and unblock that vid.. If yt don't want to unblock it, you can sue that platform before the court.. Or saying raw meat is good for you The point is, did you acquire all the materials in the legal way ?. If not, it doesn't matter that you keep it away from the public access..

Cant really get that much of the good food here.. Also acv has so many uses.. I have metals, toxins stored from a recent airplane fume event.. Acv really helps in discharging all that Depends on what kind of thing is stored in it too.. I am interested in that too because i did not hear what Aajonus had to say about that.. And where to store food.. ACV+coconut cream+ blueberries+raspberries would be potent remover of poisons picked up a bunch of organic blueberries and raspberries to go with my coconut cream actually doesn't taste that bad, but i still drink it fast i've done it a few times I don't know its probably good to write and ask..

4055,"or at least did you rinse your mouth out with milk after?. like teeth otehrwise it oculd pull minerals from bone yeah im curious too.. i know he said it can remove too much minerals so be sure to eat plenty milk/cheese with it Meat, there is probably many things you can put even a deep one raw honey would be the best thing to put on a cut Do you remember where Aajonus said about the later part ?. Where it causes bleed because of mineral deficiency and give it runs because it damages mucosal lining ?. Because I got some raw acv and add a little to the kefir i drink sometimes.. oh yeah that's right so we know aajonus was against antibiotics.. so if someone gets a deep cut ACV is good for removing all kinds of congestion in the body.. But too much too often can lead to gum bleed due to mineral loss, and also damage the intestinal mucosal lining, giving the runs Could be toxins dumping from the brain or stones that were stuck in the salivary glands i wonder if it would help with aneurysms too aajonus used it to remove cholesterol deposits in his arteries or preferred Yea it helps.. Acv has amino acids that can bind with toxic metals.. But if you use it too much it can damage the enamel of the teeth.. This comes from one of his Q&A would ACV help dissolve stones?. i bet so apparently removing heavy metals from the brain/nerves is the most difficult a thin layer of beef",12,264

I think he was about how he got his spine radiated and his bone on the teeth melted and he couldn't chew anything without bleeding.. Sorry I can't remember from which q&a.. Yes it's due to ACV using too many minerals in binding with toxins.. I experienced both symptoms when I got carried away by the effectiveness of experimenting with ACV interesting that the body would deplete teeth first I remember the part where enamel can be removed because of acv or lemon.. And that we use minerals to detox too.. Especially when you have white tongue..

The research linking it to bacterial causes is fairly convincing at first glance.. 😂 Clearly a garbage study.. Coffee is a big industry and they’ll say anything positive about it make tea out of it There are other ways to get energy then coffee and they are safer like goats milk who is high in adrenaline precursors.. If you need energy in the first place that mean your body is using it else where.. Coffee is neurotoxin, you literally poison your brain and body, its one of the toxic foods you can drink.. Don't try to come up with excuses if you crave it.. I have been addicted for it and it was the best thing i did when i quit it.. I remember how i had to drink it or else there wouldn't be any energy at all to do anything.. It exhaust the adrenals and fucks with your system pretty good, makes you addictive to it... It damages your nerves, make your system too acidic , can make you infertile and much more.. The worse part is that over time it loses it effects so you have to make it stronger.. Coffee is a catalyst for many diseases.. If I remember there's like ~50 toxins with coffee and 4 cups is a lot to remove toxins http://www.livescience.com/49500-coffee-melanoma.html and protects the cells i think it prevents the toxic affects on the gut maybe i always have raw cheese floating in my tummy/system constantly i eat big cubes of raw unsalted cheese with it i do Yeah alcohol is a poison.. Best to load with fats before a drinking session, at least an hour before but you still will feel depleted (hungover) im actually surprised that a lot of raw unsalted cheese doesnt prevent it oh and plenty of raw eggs and butter to replenish the liver's fat raw meat def helps neutralize it..probably the b12 it's too bad even with plenty of raw unsalted cheese, and clay and coconut cream after, that drinking still gives a hangover cool...i def feel good after taking it Yes it does might be garbage study",19,455

But that is about it but i feel sluggish even with just 1-2 sometimes.. oh well, i dont need it hmm Otherwise those benefits disappear I think the point is to consume only a small amount 😆 and i do think it is unnecessary when following the primal diet i know aajonus is anti-caffeine/coffee does anyone think that coffee/caffeine has beneficial health effects?. there is quite a lot of studies that indicate so but it could have health properties also my fat tissues are quite saturated at this point but they can give me strange gut biome effects, not sure if good or bad.. they are grown in shit so maybe aajonus would approve?. lol psilocybin mushrooms feel rather benign even if you eat the edibles, i think 95% of them use a solvent to extract the cannabinoids marijuana is def not harmless either it's amazing how socially acceptable it is Yea can only partially mitigate.. i'm fairly pufa deficient 😊 We can go for a walk..

It went boom, boom, boom.. AV   That’s usually because you have very loose heavy metals, especially mercury..ah... Q   If I eat high fat diet in general does that affect my heart ??. AV   Yeah, you start cleaning out, so the heart has to pump fast so those don’t settle in the heart, and if it moves the blood faster by pumping heart faster, the blood will move faster and when it moves that fast, the only way, the only place it can store is in the intestines and it dumps into the intestines.. If you’re eating cheese, will take it out, so you can lower that heart rate by just eating the cheese and helping pull it out of your intestine.. Q   I ate a lot of cheese last night..

Farmers are sold cotton seed to feed cows.. Cotton seed would be one of the most toxic seeds known to man due the chemicals used on the plant .. I know first hand.. I had a working holiday on a cotton farm during picking season.. I was the cook on the property.. Then I worked in a cotton gin (cotton processing plant) There I read their promotional material.. They proudly stated they sold seed to farmers for food supplementation.. I've searched that on google since then to see  if they still do that and they do despite all that people should know about toxicity and what we feed animals that we eat we also take in their toxins..

At least i don't think we have that problem in Europe.. But generally you might have problem with any animals that is not grass fed.. Here they feed corn silage that is sprayed with pesticides.. What a disaster Grass finishing increases the concentration of conjugatedlinoleic acids (CLAs) by a factor of between two and threecompared to grain finishing.15 CLAs are a group of fattyacids that include linoleic acid (LA), an omega-6 fatty acid,and α-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid.. Bothare essential fatty acids (EFAs) because they cannot besynthesized by humans and are only available from certainfoods.16 Several animal and human studies suggest thatCLAs are associated with many benefits, including reducedcancer risk, reduced cardiovascular disease risk and bettercholesterol levels.17,18 Although the exact physiologicmechanisms behind these benefits are not completelyunderstood .. Grassfed meat also contains higher levels of antioxidants,including vitamins E and A, as well as superoxidedismutase and catalase, enzymes that scavenge freeradicals that cause oxidation and spoilage.. Higherantioxidants are better for meat quality (retarding spoilagefrom lipid peroxidation) and beneficial to the consumer.23From a food safety perspective, grain feeds create amore acidic environment in a ruminant animal’s gutand digestive tract, making it more conducive to E.. coliformation.24,25,26 In addition, over 73% of large CAFOsnow report using subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics intheir cattle feed as a “health or production managementtool.”",21,435

As much as you can as long as you just don't gulp it down fast.. I sometimes drink 3L of fermented milk with honey per day.. Without honey i would not be able to drink that much..

Also trees block emf really well.. If i would go looking for a house i would built it myself or get one where there is some land to keep chickens at least.. Ultimately i would want a cow.. You should not drink milk cold.It should not be stored below 7C°, cold milk contracts stomach.. there is more Sure, this is my ultimate goal The house should have tiles or stone floors, or wooden unpainted, unprocessed floors without any paint.Aajonus have talked about this.. Tiles are ok as long as you don't scratch them because fired clay has some toxic metals to it.. Also if getting stone slabs for floor it should be checked for radiation and arsenic.. But the manufacturer might do that before its sold.",10,190

It's more acidic depends on your blood ph level which meat u should eat Yes this is exactly what I said to her, eventually she agreed 😅 except that I have to promise to not put EMF levels above all when choosing where to live and how to live.. This is reasonable as there hundreds of aspects to take into consideration, EMF being just one of them its useless if you live in mongolia.but if you live in a city you can find out if your house is radiated and wher exactly.maybe the side of your bed in your room gets super unsafe and if you just change position or switch room it will help.or you can find out new antennas builded near by..

Not if you want reliable results.. its ok 1 axis cornet is great too.i know few emf geeks who have both cornet and trifield if there was any problem or difference they would say.. Its one axis If i would have to choose between trifield or cornet i would choose cornet.. Trifield website is like a dropshiping tier level website.. How i am supposed to know the device can show me reliable results?. They don't tell that they did any lab tests on these devices.. Very little information about the company or its past.. According to them trifield accuracy is +-20%  at 1GHZ.. Haku wrote to gigahertz solution and they told him that trifield is scamming people.. Cornet is older company incorporated in 2007 , can't say anything about them.Maybe someone from usa could call these companies up and ask some questions.. trifield is 6ghz https://youtu.be/5a-zdhp9zcM im sure its good and reliable just 3.6 ghz isnt high enough.. Gigahertz solution is the most respect company in the sense of protection from Emf.. I would agree that the price is high, but its high for a reason.. A lot of experts who have experience in home protection from emf recommend this company for a reason.https://www.gigahertz-solutions.de/en/about-us/experts-opinions/ cornet is 1 axis in rf too im quite sure.yiu just measure all axis not that problem Accuracy 20% wow :D",28,411

You could be lacking bacteria in your gut to help you digest things.. In your position i would keep eating raw cheese cubes every hour to soak up the poisons in your gut.. Make milkshakes too and keep drinking them dont add any fruit to them and make sure the milk is not cold.. You could also make milkshakes from fermented milk.. Eat everything by little bit.. Set the timer to wake up when you slept for 5 hours and drink some not cold raw milk or raw egg.. If you are going to drink milk eat it with honey, the same would go for the butter.. Slowly it will get better",13,186

Last summer I started regularly having raw milk, cut out all processed shit and started pretty much everything raw in October.. Lately I've mainly just been drinking milk, eggs and honey because that's all I want though, so not really primal.. Nice.. Gaining weight eating that way?. I would kill a jar of raw honey a day with milk sometimes lol Yeah at one point I literally would eat up to half a kilo of honey a day.. Based on my irises, my pancreas was pretty fucked.. So that's probably why.. I haven't actually weighed myself lol, but it looks like I've gained weight.. Interesting about the irises do you guys have any links that make it easy to understand?. I feel like my eyes are hard to read Brown eyes are usually harder to read imo Unless the quality of the picture is really high I have green but thank you I’m gonna use that chart To my understanding, green eyes should be blue and will change over years of doing primal",12,198

You can also do experimental tests for your skin.. Like fishskin on your skin or honey and over it the eggshell membrane.. you could also check the chinese face map (face-organ relationship) or Iridology to find out which of your organs isnt in the right shape....

At first i craved fresh, unfermented milk but now i crave fermented ones.. I take it out of the fridge that is set to 7C°  and it ferments in a few days then i drink it.. Sometimes it gets little bit bitter but that depends on the bacteria that dominates.Don't forget to drink raw milk slowly don't gulp it down and with raw honey Yea, the milk i drink I just let it stand in a dark warm place and drink it after 2-3 days.. Beef meat with beef fat ofc, port meat with pork fat ofc, etc.. Confirm you are not a Müllet Should just be blue and brown, some eyes look brown but are actually meant to be blue though.. It's the really dark brown ones that should be brown.. At least that's what I heard.. Fascinating.... 🤔 thanks!. A lot of people associate white tongue with candida or eating carbs.. Especially since you start raw primal your body is detoxing from the mouth , especially from the gums and tongue.. Because our brain is made of fat, that's where most of the toxins go.. White tongue is minerals binding with the toxins and exiting true the tongue.. You get dry mouth because your body is using all the fat in the nearby cells for detoxing and binding with toxins, you are not eating enough fat or butter.. To fix the problem eat a piece of butter or any other fat until dry mouth disappears.I have white tongue since i started primal, dry mouth too.. These remedies that i talked about fixes dry mouth.. For white tongue it takes time, slowly over time the detox gets smaller and smaller then disappears.. Eating accordingly could speed up the process.. This information comes from Q&A and other Aajonus sources.Carbs like fruits increases detoxification.. So would you rather eat organic supermarket meat or non organic but fresh from a butcher?. Those te kind of my options haha Have some butter/honey mixture for dry mouth, swish it around the mouth to allow the fats to reabsorb.. @mustafaljuboori https://youtu.be/FhdawUxnNqY Are*",25,380

As I am new into this diet pattern, I am bit confused about leaving my fresh raw milk just sourced from my local farmer next door as recommended by Aajonus : « It is best to warm milk,or let it stand in a dark warm cupboard several hours before drinkingit.. I let mine stand for at least 24 hours prior to drinking to allowthe natural bacteria in milk to predigest it for me.»Does anyone have any personal positive experiment with this procedure ?. Does it really improve the digestion when you suffer from a compromised gut ?. Do you leave the entire milk jar outside warming until empty or a cup at a time ?. Good question Usually there is a disclaimer about who funded the research Sorry, I don’t 😎 Damn Buy a mullet wig if you can That way you can play a funny joke on people This is a long one20060507SD 01:30:10Q: Colostrum is better then milk?A: It depends.. Colostrum is the milk produced by cow for the first 5 days after giving birth, most of the fat is not in the cream but in a butter form, liquid butter form, so its much easier to digest, remember i stated before that cream has to go true quiet a process, two thirds of [unintelligible] of an enzymatic activity to separate H²O from the fat to make it to butter to lubricate and strength two thirds of its body needs, only one third of the cream can be utilised to help the nervous system.. But the other two thirds of that fat has to be made into like butter fat.. So the first 5 days its butter fat not cream fat so it stabilises that calf as soon as its born.. It gives it 5 day to firm solid, make things more solid in his skin, his hair, everything.. And if it just had cream it would be anaemic.Q: [unintelligible] and raw milk ?A: I think both if you have [unintelligible].. I am eating both butter and cream.. Right now i am eating sheep milk and sheep butter.. So you need that lubrication formula.. As long as you have dryness you need 2 lubrication formulas a day.",15,373
4188,hi primals do you get eggs from the supermarket sometimes?. It may be a really general question but how do one know a research /study is trustworthy and not biased,2,30
4189,"Where are you from ?. Alright, thanks anyway Aajonus said to eat thyroids Thanks 🤓 Would you eat it if it’s not organic?. Let’s say cows or pigs.. That’s probably the only I can get 🤔 Well, there’s no organic that I know near me, at least not big animals, they are all farmed.... it should be grass fed, no vaccines or other substances.. I can only get rabbits or chickens, they normally don’t come with the thyroid, but I’ll ask :) Best not to eat organs and glands from not properly raised animals.. As that's where toxins accumulate..

That was the only place i have heard of Aajonus talking about sheep milk and all he said is that he is drinking it and eating sheep butter and milk excited Put yourself in a position where the corporations have minimal control over your life i'll be trying pastured sheep milk soon From videos i saw people are vaccinating sheep like crazy.. They talk how weak they are and how disseased they get,, in general i see sheep as weaker more sensitive to pollution animals because they get sick so much more unlike cattle.. So of course people use more medicine and drugs on them so over time the generations gets poisoned.. One farmer said me how the breed of sheep that he has have diarrhoe if they dont have any cover from rain.. So you know that these animals are polluted and detoxing from it.. But its possible to find well raised and not poisoned sheep.. Yes you are right I think Aajonus said worms are made from the body to help clean out toxins I think the reason the animals get parasites is because they’re toxic.. Maybe from the environment or food Here not all people have organic logo on their products but you can get sheep that its farmed on a pasture without any grain.. But sheep in general are more vaccinated and  probably got forcefed with dewormer, but you have to look and maybe you can find something great.. I dont think everyone vaccinate their flok.. If some farmers would have more braincells they could actually raise and breed sheep that is more resistant to parasites and they could not use dewormers at all.. Maybe you could find some goats Yes.. Maybe you are rightThey are cheaper.. And they complement each other I love liver and kidneys Hard decission I would just not eat them if i cant find properly raised animal organs.. In his meal plans Aajonus does not recommend to eat organs, you don't have to eat them.. Its not necessary.. The cons weight out the pros.. You have to be careful not to poison yourself.. At least in Europe is not that bad, a lot of chemicals and drug use on animals is banned.. Yes.. I have read the Bible.. But thanks for showing it..

American Indians would only eat pemmican if they would be starving.. So if its dry aged for too long it might be better to look for fresher options if it would be possible( i don't think if its aged for 28 days it loses all of its enzymes so it might still be good) , when water leaves the meat bacteria and enzymes die, i was not able to find Aajonus talking about dry aging but i think its still better then frozen meat.. Freezing food alters, damages, or destroys most enzymes and damages many vitamins .. The colder the food gets the more nutrients are destroyed.. The nutrients in meat are especially harmed by freezing.. So you would have to choose.. Fresh is always the best.. Most of the answers that you need can be found in Aajonus books.. Hi Phil.. Nothing wrong with dry aged.. And using a fridge would be better than freezing meat as freezing might destroy some nutrients and bacteria",13,191

When we eat highmeat our stomach acid is killing almost every bacteria (i guess...) so why do we get high?. if its not the bacteria?. the byproducts of bacteria?. Acid is not only released in the stomach but in the intestines too.. Certain bacteria can live.. When food is broken down in the stomach enzymes come and break it down even more, bacteria then can digest it fast because it is already broken down in a way.. Our gut has more bacteria then any other place you could find on earth so comparing it would be foolish Raw animals digest so fast but I really don't see how the bacteria plays any part in it you know after thinking about it I mean the enzymes in raw animal is definitely digest a lot faster when they're raw than cooked.. Yeah man I've been saying it for the past year that bacteria helps digest food but the other day I just wondered like wait a minute how does that work you know Anyone has an answer for grendel?. cuz I wanna know aswell it sounds logical I am trying to build my tolerance to raw milk but for some odd reason I can handle raw kefir and sour cream perfectly fine",11,236
4226,"Do u think freezing meat is terrible?. I don't really think that eating Primal should be compared to machinery like that but I know what you're saying.. Enzymes are like machines in a factory.. You see sometimes images from e.g.. a car factory, there are production lines with arm-like machinery.. Enzymes are such machinery on a chemical level.. Raw foods are packages containing nutrients with machines (enzymes) to utilize these nutrients.. Enzymes are less durable then some nutrients, so when you cook food, you destroy most of enzymes and the body will be forced to produce it's own enzymes.. I think it may negatively affect female hormones They just label it not for human consumption That's raw and organic too You can buy bath milk shipped to your house To a point False Only bad thing about Australia is  poor access to raw cows milk Fresh, not frozen and fairly priced In Australia they have grass fed beef erryday 🏪🏪 Sucks.. All my meat is frozen Everytime I have ate frozen meat, I wake up with eczema on my skin If you eat previously frozen raw meat, guarantee you will develop a skin disorder.. but then like I said even if they're not destroyed what significant impact would they even have on helping us digest our food considering how slow they are at digesting compared to us Fucked me up too.. Made me feel like a bitch lol always whining I didn’t know this, fuck Same The chewing though 😂😂 Thanks!. But I’m not sure if some could thrive on it I didn’t do well w zero carb egg yolk i also heard the guy who runs organic pastures siphons off some of the cream let the milk get to room temp to make more profit i remember reading somewhere maybe wewan2live that aajonus said the guy who runs organic pasture (forgot his name) siphons off some of the cream I think so maybe Maybe idk .. They really skimp on the cream it’s like water lol I heard its actually human milk packaged as cow milk private food cooperatives/groups",14,350
4227,what brands are in AZ?,1,5
4228,Coops as if the supermarket?,1,5
4229,"or maybe not totally grass fed?. i think it's because the Cali mainstream brands use irrigated grass or soemthing Nah claravale same imo.. I got my milk from aajonus’ food share when I lived in LA .. Now I live in AZ the milk is way better imo In central London there’s this place called selfridges and Harrods and they sold raw milk so rich people could easily buy do you have co-ops in england But you can see how the government is making it harder One raw milk business called hook and son were not allowed to sell raw milk for a year and this  happened in 2018 but now they’re back in to business as their cows passed the tests do you prefer claravale Yeah organic pastures sucks there’s no cream Yeah I have to buy it as pet milk haha that's not good, could easily leverage that I like Save Your Dairy it’s a2 and super creamy .. Even Fond Du Lac at sprouts has thick 2inch of cream in each half gallon it’s great psh good to know if im ever out there yeah i get A1 because its cheaper and i have no problems Going to play with my son Well I'm just assuming because cooking meat kills the bacteria Fun talking to you all I'm tired It’s so fucking good man just try it’s not too strong ;) Has anyone bought chocolate milk from brown cows i feel like ginger would be a weird flavor",5,251
4230,"never tried that one - is it strong tasting?. ahhh The organic pastures keifer with tumeric and ginger is like crack tho I love that stuff lol Also Organic pastures chill the milk to 32 farenheit (Thats 0 celcius) that is why Aajonus did not buy from it.(it should be 44 farenheit  6.5 celcius) But he said that in 2006 so they might not do it anymore no way around that...butter is so pricey.... Why?. I have access to it but never tried Ya I do just kinda spendy and lengthy process i guess you could always make your own butter If you’re ever in Phoenix go to Healthy Habit they have Save Your Dairy gallons weekly .. Only bad thing is no raw butter here Different protein idk A2 is supposed to be easier digested What’s the difference between a2 diary and a1, ?. I heard some people say that a2 is better but I don’t get why if both are raw predigested And if that happens then they suspend raw milk production for 3 months the raw milk in the stores in Cali are not optimum but there are other sources but raw meat, especially red, gives me that feeling of ""primal power"" Probably same as you i thin i can survive okay on raw milk, cheese, honey, butter, eggs raw meat was a big game changer First time i found raw goat milk the farmer saw me start chugging and he said in this bogan accent,  ""you really are a goat milk boy!"" what about you but didt make the jump to raw meats and such until about a year ago i had known about the dangers of PUFA and other toxins but drank quite a bit of pasteurized goat milk i had dabbled in raw milk prior to that almost a year ago and i have gulped it before without problems, but now i def dont in case it isnt being utilized enough When did you start primal lifestyle even when i used to drink pasteurized i could drink it cold without problems Are we brothers Tastes salty, almost seafood.. Me too i prefer it cold and i have no problems with drinking it slowly while cold and sour a bit raw eggs are more mental energy.. red meat is like total energy throughout My neighbors just got chickens :D like i can take on anything raw milk is soothing and calming Like they’d say 1 cow is positive TB On those cows and always try to catch something out oh thats good Totally open or legal for private to private",8,435
4231,"legal in the grocery stores too?. It’s legal but government agencies do these tests It's legal David Great contribution Phil what are the laws like there for it in the England raw milk is so good , some farms don’t use pesticides fertilisers and chemicals on their grass lands , and the animals only eat grass, the way they handle the milk and sell it to us in glass but due to lockdown they stopped doing markets only deliveries Cmon pal Phil is typing Ok i dont have setup for baths right now no Do you do milk baths i also need cucumbers and tomatoes and hydrating Buh bye And it takes years for bacteria to digest food so the significance that it has in our bodies is trivial compared to the time the food will pass through our digestive tract ebrahim has mental problems unfortunately, and he does not stay on the diet consistently",2,155

You see something tiny on a microscope and you speculate about it like about black holes that we never seen Im going to hunt for grass fed beef liver now Correct, our bodies manufacture viruses (solvents) to remove pollutants from our body when bacteria,parasites,fungi can not.. Mostly viral detoxifications happen in already toxic individual where life cant prosper.. oh i see, im addicted to them lool No debate here brother, when we have colds, aajonus said it comes without or with very little virus, American medical dictionary says Coronavirus is associated with common cold, so the logic that our immune system hasn’t come in contact with it is ridiculous even by allopathic medicine standards, they stipulate that viruses mutate every 3 weeks or so, which means “anytime we have a virus, it’s probably a new strain” those two things together never made sense to me.. I was sold by aajonus when I ate raw mince with no negative effect, when that was the “most dangerous thing” before raw chicken According to Aajonus our body can make 3000 different kinds of viruses.. There is so many ways corona virus could be made ""real"", by blaming common cold on it, or in general blaming other disease on corona.. In my own humble opinion the corona thing was made to not get trump elected or in a way to sell vaccine, maybe there are other things happening behind the covers, you would have to be insider to really know these things.. I remember being Zika virus, blaming it on mosquito, that was a really good smokescreen.. People would not look in to the real problem causer - pollution.. But rather to a mosquito.. There are many instances on blaming pollution and toxicity caused problems on nature like lyme dissease Haha not really, I left that country at age 11 I’m with you Vilt, just confused by Nikitas comment Wow I think I currently have spinal meningitis I think he said 300000 viruses , because we have 300000 different type of tissues",19,439
4266,"i want to see his data on this.... how does he came to the conclusion that there are 3000 viruses ?. You have to understand at where he is at.. If you are a doctor you really cant go against the mainstream, and if you would think that viruses are not contagious you would have to lie to your patients, because that would be forbidden thinking.. Yet for some strange reason i see a blink of light in this, maybe Nikita could study Aajonus work and learn what all there is to learn.. With his degree as a doctor he could open his own hospital and treat people Aajonus way.. He could use some of the knowledge and prove Aajonus work again.. It is a bliss to have events that happened to Aajonus to point you to truth.. First i have to find where he said it.. He has sources in his newsletter and his book.. You have to look in to it yourself, i can not give it to you on a plate.. I didn’t, they are telling us it does, what I am saying is that they contradict themselves on every level.. I believe in terrain theory, otherwise why would I be here.. I just have read much of their literature and it always contradicts itself, and now there is a doctor who has come out proving that all virus documented diseases don’t adhere to the Kochs postulates they are meant to, which means they have never correctly studied any “illness” they have written as “fact”, this whole pandemic made me look at more information and it has just solidified aajonus’ findings Fair point no prob dude How is your luck with raw milk ?. You can introduce it slowly Yes you did not say it.. What i mean is that the viral detox would happen either way they are happening now and have been in the past.. Coronavirus is a smoke screen.. im trying it next week n yeah im going very slowly - maybe butter n creme first.. sounds like raw poetry I am under the impression that viruses are part of our immune system, part of our defence Hollllaaaaaa They were even 🤫 Banana smoothie adviced for backaches: (my size)3 raw eggs75ml raw cream60ml raw unheated honey250g unripe bananaTook that and went to bath, right now the soreness in my back has mitigated 80% I didn’t say it was bosnia Viruses are not contagious There is no such thing as an immune system.. The hospitals and doctors combined with industrial pollution and their drugs are the ones who are killing people.. Is this germ theory?. Coronavirus has been known to come with common colds, this literally goes against primal thinking, sure viral detoxes are one of the most aggressive but shouldn’t you be fine if you are highly nourished and protecting with high raw fat content which country My mother spanked me too much as a child whats the cause lol Oh nice to meet you Im like run dmc mixed with John Gotti What a mothefuckin bad ass interesting - thx dude..

Toxins were moving in my bowels and killing or scaring e-coli, thus my mood went low.. Yea sometimes it happens to me too..

On the talk, Aajonus said some spinal meningitis may last upto a year or more.. Except the mosquitos I feel the mosquitoes won't bother me this summer Mosquitos are the worst.. Once i wanted to sleep outside, but guess what the mosquitos were there already and you cant sleep when they are around, constantly causing an itch Yeah that's bad regarding sleeping with them If i go to the country side the sky is always full of starts and its a wonderfull thing to sleep outside and see all of this Also, on the Q&A, I found it interesting that daily 90min baths may cause too much detox, since once the lymphatic congestion melts it gets dumped to connective tissue!Therefore it's good to do long baths every 3 days, and sweat in between them, or do the smaller baths (30-45min) that clear connective tissue!",14,341

4276,"Interesting .. I’m gonna try this with a quart of raw cream.. How long should I shake it for?. Leave it out at room temp?. Any other suggestions?. The cream should be cold.. Shake it until the butter forms you will understand it yourself.. Sour cream churns faster in my experience.. Ok .. Like an hour of shaking ?. Lol Depends on how strong and fast you shake.. Give it a go and see it for yourself.. When i tried it it was a hastle and took some time, that's why i don't do it.. I rather build a device that could do it for me.. Remember to share you experience when you are done.",15,115
4277,"Ok I will.. The shaking is “churning” essentially right?. yes yeah...the mainstream says that sugar/citric acid causes cavities but aajonus said it is from heavy metal detox He also said 20070610LA 31:00 Q: Can teeth regenerate like bone can ?. A: Yes its possible, but depends.. For younger people, not so much for older cheese with honey...mix it in the mouth let it sit in there provides all the minerals for regenerating bone two tomatoes...so hydrating after a walk!. and some gerolsteiner Give it a listen yourself",6,87

With the experiment part i can confirm, the ""dna of bacteria, parasites and fungi are already in our body ready to be used and made for detox "" i am still looking and reading so cant really tell anything about that DNA part, i was thinking the parasites are in eggs and fungi are in spores so they can lie dormant including bacteria as long as they want or until they are needed, I ate just eggs and milk for 4 days straight.. Felt okay but not very grounded.. Functional, but not optimal I love this whole moment Our bodies are smart and in a way can transfer the bacteria or fungi where ever it needed for cleaning and detoxing.. Ok but how do we get eggs with parasites or fungi spores...you think we get it with food after we are born?. I thought that we are already born with all those things inside our cells to develop when we need it https://youtu.be/bNFjLFcrfFs eggs n spores are ubiquitously present.. maybe the body allows them to evolve/enter when its needed.. idk What is going on haha haha Cant really give you a full answer but i can give an example.. Aajonus would recommend to clean a particular organ, gland by eating high version of it, when it is full of bacteria or fungi eating that organ or gland, when we eat that part, our body take those fungi, bacteria and transfer it to our organs,glands were it can begin cleaning it, detoxing.. Still i am looking for the information related to it.. Thanks a lot This is just new type of seasonal flu which is unknown to our immune system so it is overreacting to it killing the host and the virus at the same time.. Time shall tell - it is going to come and kill people with every cold season until we completely adapt to it.. I'm from balkans, maybe genetics The question is how they did know about butter ?. I still don’t see they came up with the idea if we churn milk we gonna get butter 🤔",16,415
4280,"Do you know how much one of these bad boys cost?. You will have to look one for yourself, at least i would built it myself.. Or you could talk with some carpenter and it could built it for you, i think the better ones would be the ones that rotate the whole barrel not the inside because there would be a need for using a rotating a rod in the middle of the barrel and if it would be made of wood a leak could happen, so they would use a metal connecting rod or a bearing which is no good.. There are more devices like these take a look https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_churn I remember it being only eggs..

After couple days I got fever and achy throat.. It was chilly but sunny to work ""We"" as in our ancestors and us Yes this is true.. But it doesn't negate that we allowed our lives to become more comfortable and thus we've distanced ourselves from natural living and become suspectible for more toxins 90% of disease is caused from pollution.. People would in the older days be much stronger because their bodies did not have to clean and protect themselves from all the shit that we do now.. Well what he mean is that people would die because of how toxic their body is and, if temperatures would cool or get to high then those toxins would end up killing them because the body would have to generate energy to fight cold or use other nutrients to fight of heat.. It's very hard to not give in to things that make our lives easier but at the same time rob our freedom and strength Comfort breeds weakness There may be some truth to weaponizing wild animals, but it's more about making people afraid of nature and disconnecting them from nature Slither I love the 4 distinct seasons Finland offers..

Most importantly would be for you to sleep and keep supplying your body with nutrients.. Fever is generally a sign that your body is already stopping a detoxification and it should pass.. After that healing would come.. Cheese could also help, don't forget to eat it with butter as it might cause constipation.. Headaches are the main issue and i tried a few things that he said about them, it worked to drink good water with lemon and honey and does not work now You should still make the pain formula and slowly drink it, you could grate the cheese and eat it little by little..

I didn't realize it was salted until after I finished the meal.. A few hours later I got an intense migraine from the salt.... Just like Aajonus said, salt causes headaches..

Maybe 6Liters.. Not bad,how do you make cheese I put the curds in a cheese press with a cloth over night, i did not use any cultures.. Then i kept it in room temperature until mold formed and then put it in waxed paper and then in to fridge.. The reason it worked out so well was because it was only slightly wet and not that much whey in it.. I am still working on technique to see what works and what not.. Because the other cheeses that i made the whey content in it was high and it was pretty wet.. It is strange because the curds even if i would heat it to 37C would still be wet.. I wonder how others make the raw cheese.. Do they heat it ?. I will try some without even heating it.. See how it goes.. I only done hard cheese a few times and i think its possible without heating it at all.. That’s cool, I never tried to make raw cheese I might one day.. It’s also a lot cheaper than buying it.. And I’m not sure I think I’ve seen videos where they heat it @antonleiton",19,284

What’s your day of eating look like Salt is poison - a catalyst for disease and suffering.. Before primal i would eat a lot of salt, use it almost as dipping sauce, really high amounts that would always make me really thirsty and i would drink litters of tap water in one go.. Every week i would have at least one headache, sometimes they would be so strong that i could not walk, sometimes it would be mild, they generally would last a day.. When i went primal and stopped using salt, they went away instantly.. I would still get them rarely but i had Aajonus remedy for headache caused by salt and it would always work and the pain would disappear..

4332,"Were not you then one that showed a picture of cheese press made from wood ?. I am Ok then your prob right Aajonus was sensitive individual to pollution and everything that does our body harm.. He got this sensitivity  from all his medications, x-ray, vaccines and other poisons he had consumed and was put true.. That was the reason he found a lot of what he found, the problems these things would cause would become too big to ignore.. He would get problems from other non raw foods too.. Some individuals would be as sensitive as him, some would not.. There where individuals not sensitive to cooked foods and they , when the disease would be cured by Aajonus remedies, go back to eating as they were.. Ultimately it was their choice he could not do anything about it, just warn them, they were not as sensitive and would not feel these effects, they had Achilles heel.. They would chose taste over health, but i know it is possible to make tasty raw foods too..

I feel like i crave it and can drink a lot I was deficient in vit d & craved it like crazy Maybe also has to do w the fact that I was a milk addict as a kid 🤪 My guess would be fulfilling nutrient needs, being generally healthy makes you look better and melanin can be properly made Yeah it's addicting Yeah but it makes my eyes kinda brighter i thought melanin is a dark pigment You right I am quite unscientific thus far I think it'll just taste stronger and ferment quick I prefer non organic fresh than organic frozen.. But aajonus told to do half and half if you have no better options Yes almost every day For around 2 hours And started introducing private areas",3,144
4334,"Does that have something to do with my eyes?. David your face looks thick like a babyface - beautiful!. Thank you Yeah from a few days About bitter part.. Aajonus talked how there are different kinds of bacteria in the milk and it depends on what kind of bacteria dominates, the one might make it sweet the other makes it bitter.. It still should be good to drink.",5,68
4335,"What about putting the milk under sun for few hours?. Would it produce different strains of bacteria maybe?. Sometimes when i keep milk even in dark place some of the batches become bitter, some sour and sometimes creamy like yogurt.. There were batches that even were sparkling..

I can’t find it 🤷🏽 I noticed that too, 10 days in fridge and was bitter and sparkling, but I liked it You would also have to remove the milk from the fridge because when it ferments in the fridge for too long it becomes really bitter.. If you want to ferment the milk it is better to remove cream to other jar and let it become sour cream or mix it in with the milk because it will play with fermentation.. Most of the times if cream is on the top it will make the fermentation bitter, if the lid is closed on the jar it will make it bitter.. I am talking from experience I sometimes crave it and just scoop it in my mouth from all bottles",7,197

You should not worry about iron or any other nutrients overdoses when you are on raw diet.. I don’t understand why vegetable iron is needed though i dont eat vegetable iron To avoid iron overdose you can switch up your meats e.g eat pork, fish, chicken , beef is iron all that necessary?. someone mentioend ray peat earlier and he is more anti-iron But vegetarians eat milk and eggs no iron there 5-7 days ya but he has said there are people who just eat milk and eggs because eventually the lack of iron and other nutrients would pose a problem but it's a short term thing right ya He talked about a lady who had like a week left to live or something and she ate 60’eggs in 2 days and survived",5,165
4341,"or they could get ill again?. right yeah but eventually they would need the other nutrients only provided by meat I think he might of meant that people who are ill would find eggs useful because it’s the easiest to digest compared to raw meat when i had a membership maybe on the WW2L website i could have sworn i saw him say somewhere that people can do well on an all egg diet is that he said it is the utlimate compact fast food okay so what i found so far but that’s why he recommends meat yeah im not a fan of kale even in a juice also i've never heard of ground liver.. do you grind it yoruself?. be careful abour oxidation destroying nutrients grinding meat destroys some of the nutrients via oxidation You could take pictures for comparison.. Eyes are window to your bodies health so i assume if you see a difference it might be for the better.. Around 3-4 weeks For all, this waiting period is because the bacteria passes a stage where it might cause very deliberate detox.. Aajonus recommended making patee and letting that get high Do high meat not high liver these things are different.. 4 weeks it says on the high meat recipe.. If its in fridge you have to re air it every 3-4days outside 2days but that speeds up the bacteria and makes it turn high faster , it would be ready in 2 weeks.. SYPHILIS is a viral detoxification affecting almost any organ or tissuein the body, especially genitals, skin, mucous membranes, aorta, brain,liver, bones and nerves, and is caused by the inability to utilize caffeineand cooked green foods.. Extreme acidity and accumulation of volatiletoxins deteriorate cells, forcing the body to manufacture this virus enmasse.. aajonus said viral detox wikipedia says syphiliys is actually caused by a bacterium",12,311

They told him that a woman with whomhe had had an intense sexual relationship for three months was insecond stage syphilis.. He called me immediately, horrified:“Byron,” I said, “in order for syphilis to flourish in your body, youwould have to have acute toxicity in your nervous system.. You havebeen on a raw diet for years, so you’re clean enough of toxins.. Godown to the clinic and have the test, but I suggest you do not takemedication.. It is meant to poison the virus but viruses are not aliveand cannot be poisoned.. The medication poisons millions of healthycells and causes the body to stop manufacturing detoxifying virus.”“But Aajonus, this is syphilis,” Byron shouted.“Go get the test done and then you will know.”About a half hour later, Byron called again.. He was at the clinic.“Everyone here is panicked because I refused the medication.. Theysay that no one is immune to syphilis and that it could already be inmy brain because the woman is in advanced second stage.. Aajonus,I’m going to take the medication.. What should I do to counteract theside effects?”“The medication is a poison.. Just buy billions of cell caskets andkiss your energy and sexuality good-bye, because they will diminishfor years to come - pardon the pun.”“Aajonus, don ’t kid around, this is serious.”“Something has to make you rational again.. Take a look at who’spromoting the fear and who’s profiting.. Trust me, you do not havesyphilis.. You have sex more than anyone I know.. That exercise in152 Volume One W E W A N T T O L I V E !. - T H E P R I M A LD I E Tconjunction with your raw diet keeps you clean and healthy.. Useyour common sense.. Panic persuades people to do all sorts of thingsthat are not beneficial.. Who in their right mind is going to drinkpoison because someone tells them to?. One or two more days isn’tgoing to melt your brain, Byron.”“Aajonus!. This is syphilis.”“I have said all I can.. It is your body, your life and you have tolive it.. It is your choice.”“Okay.. Thanks.. ‘Bye.’ ”Five minutes later, Byron called again, “Aajonus, they say I haveto take the medication.. This is syphilis.”“Would you tell me it’s syphilis one more time, just to make sure Iremember?”“Will you stop joking around?!. We’re talking about my brain andnervous system.”“Byron, right now we’re talking panic and fear.. I told you thechoice is yours.. They cannot make you take the medication.. It hasdangerous side effects.”He handed the phone to the man at the clinic, and the man said,“Excuse me, how can you be human and put this man’s life at morerisk?. Don’t you care about him, or is he just a client you take moneyfrom?. I mean, get rational, sir, this is serious.. This is syphilis.”“Now, now, be nice, and calm down.. How long will it take to getthe results?” I asked.“As early as tomorrow, if we rush it through.. But he has to beginthe medication now.”“Would you read the specific law stating that he has to takemedication, and the procedures to enforce it.”“It could take weeks to go through the procedures,” he said.“Exactly, so until a judge would rule that he would have to take it,he does not have to take it.. And for a judge to order that, a syphilispositiveblood result would be required.. Am I right?”“You have no idea the danger you are putting your client in.”“Let me ask you this, does the medication have side effects?”“Of course.”“If Byron’s test comes back negative for syphilis, would you beO U T O F T H E G R I P S O F D I S E A S E A N D D E A T H 153putting him in danger with medication?”“This is crazy.. This is syphilis.. Your ignorance is really sad.”“I have been exposed to the medical profession my entire life, soignorant regarding it, I am not..

4372,"yeah so the ""transmission link"" to sex is just bogus?. You should listen first.. I remember him talking about how one guy girlfriend tested syphilis positive and he was afraid of having it so the doctors told him to use medication before the lab results came in.. But aajonus managed to talk some sense in to him and when the test results came in it tested negative.. i mean, if you think about it, anything ould be lined The primal way would be to go raw",5,86
4373,"You mean about birth control ?. Well what should we use then not on primal, just people getting sick and pharmaceuticals wanting to make money yeah it's interesting because sex is an energy exchange yeah and a big money maker of course so perhaps if you have sex with the ""wrong person"" your body becomes depleted and you get a disease according to wikipedia though syphilis is from a bacteria not a virus Yeah makes you more fearful of having sex and then if you get a disease they'll give you poison which is beneficial is a means to scare us from physical intimacy yeah i think the ""authoriteis"" linking these diseases to sex On primal there's no worries of STDs or your dick falling off STDs that are viruses or bacteria are not transmittable.. Yeast and fungi are transmittable only if your body decides it needs it for cleansing.. Then there's also the spiritual/energetic side to getting STDs haven't looked into that yet Also condoms are probably toxic diet.. Have you worked with syphilis like I have?”“I admit ignorance to your experience, but not about syphilis.Since you are absolutely certain, would you be willing to pay onethousand dollars in damages if Byron does not have syphilis as adisease or as a carrier?”“You are crazier than I thought,” he said and hung up.“Byron did not take the medication and the test results were negative.They demanded he take the test again.. He did.. It was also negative.”________________________ I must also being doing that",7,252

Nice thanks vilt That separation seems like it can cause imbalance But cheese yo I don't know why Aajonus doesn't mention whey as hydration in his books or that much in general..

A: It is very acidic that is why i said.. Q: No i only had it with my juice.. A: You are going to have less with your juice.. Q: Is that for everybody ?. A: No, that is for her.. She has sore in her mouth that means her system is very acidic and that means she needs more of that alkalizing juice with that whey, also for you knee problem whey is good for removing mineral build ups in the joints as well as uric acid build up in the muscles that causes cramping.. Q: Could i drink whey too in smaller quantities when i make cheese ?. A: You can with 4 ounces of vegetable juice with 4 ounces of whey if you have acidic reaction then 8 ounces with 4 ounces of whey, if you get acidic reaction then 8 ounces with 2 ounces of whey.. You have to find your balance Yea i have some saved, for quick acces Two weeks into this, found out 5 mins from my house there are people selling raw dairy, raw ghee, eggs and a small goat farm We are still acidic , just too much acidity is bad..

Raw salted butter for me doesn't remove the pain.. But raw unsalted does..

In simple terms""-Thoughts?. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryke_Geerd_Hamer He puts disease cause as a problems with yourself, conflict?. There are similar ways that people believe and as long as they believe they wont get sick but that doesn't go that far.. It is still interesting how body decides when to do detox.. It is pretty easy to prove that disease are caused by toxins and our body discards it, just get puss, diarrhea or vomit analyzed when you eat raw foods, you can analyze certain inflamed peeling skin and you will see the results.. Why do you think when you have pain in your teeth the pain formula works and removes that pain from 10 to 60 minutes?. Why certain people can heal and cure the disease that they could not before when they go primal and not on other diets ?Why people cure their diabetes with primal remedy ?. Why does headaches disappear when you drink certain remedies for it ?. Why does high meat cure chronic depression ?. I don't think that is conflict related.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbN-4_NTF_w&pbjreload=10",19,326

4385,From raw food ?,1,4
4386,"Yes which , fish ?. Pretty sure It's a fat soluble vitamin so probably any raw fat Avocado too looks like Paranoia .. lol .. Just doing some research Ooo that intuitively makes sense, thx You can all talk how to eat salt in carnivore group.. I don't go there to talk about salt and call it poisonous.. What where you expecting.. Agreed, as the iron in cooked food has molecular change Aajonus said he has cramps when he drinks raw milk from refrigerator yes i eat only red meat Maybe you might want to try to eliminate red meat ^i agree I felt very sore and acidic at the beginning of this diet, i ate only red meat.. When i switched to chicken (white meat) everything changed, the soreness and the ""acidic"" feeling was gone.. I don't know if it has something to do with veins but maybe your body is too acidic, I'm assuming you are eating red meat mostly.. I think that was my problem- but PKD definitely didn’t work for me",10,175
4387,"Have u ever had your vitamin d levels checked?. Yes I’m having the exact same thing right now hmm i see, maybe my body too toxic, im having cramps more than normal then from cramps pain of veins I had to think for a sec but it wasnt the same thing, I don’t think it had anything to do w veins for me though, it just felt like a deep pain in my bones and I also had parts of my body “fall asleep” easily and feel static I kinda had something similar when I tried the “paleolithic-ketogenic diet” anyone when started diet had problem with veins, when i move my foot i get pain(on same im getting cramps), also when i sneeze all veins on my body hurts like day 1 of gym lol 😂 shown at 3:13 i always wondered about that huge piece of meat for those who haven't seen it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTl2FTgmoNU",2,155

Cause i had also cramps from goat milk.. yes but is weird because im having some symptoms that i never had , also im afraid sometimes when i dont eat much that i lack nutrition and my bones will crack lol yes raw milk cow But if we are talking about green juice its celery Mainly juices that don't have too much carbohydrates.. Vegetable juices are a supplement for vitamins, enzymes, and minerals.. If its high carbohydrate juice it will be used differently.. So its better to have low carbohydrate juice so the body doesn't use it as fuel.. 2009 10 03 03:20:43 celery,10-20% parsley and honey",12,251

And a lot of asthma vaccines.. i see, im having still struggle with diet sometimes it takes me 3 hour to finish meal lool Aajonus also said that muscle meat from supermarket is safe as long as there are no additives.. But just so you know chicken muscle meat that is not organic is safe to eat raw as long as there are no additives, i ate it for around 8 months from the supermarket, really low quality and even made high meat from it.. That's pretty cool im raising my own so need to wait maybe 1 month for them thanks i might try but hard to find soon organic chicken Just because i had significant improvement with it I would still suggest trying to go without red meat for like a week and eat white meat instead if for some reason this doesn't work.. This is from Aajonus' book but maybe is now detox or lack of nutritions i dont drink cold milk , i drink room temperature i used to have cramps even in GAPS diet or standard diet, usually from cold and when i keep my sneakers for long time He said he had cramps in his hands and feet But i didn't have problems with that any new symptoms on first weeks when you started?,  for me looks hard to gain weight also i can eat only 2 meals very hard to have 3 and sometimes a bit milk But i don't have problems with cow milk Actually i had cramps in my arms, maybe a little in feet, not stomach",8,302

Do you like feel your teeth are a bit loose or that your gums are weak?. no, i sometimes maybe in a month or 2 i brush with butter sometimes i get paranoid that if i get really sick they will send me to hospital and i will be dead if they check my cholesterol,ferritin etc lol brain flukes are your friends oh and, aged wet clay (terramin) for bacteria and parasites too and yes the bacteria ""communicate"" to us the bacteria are actually telling me to sleep right now, but i unfortunately am at work and hopefully heavy metals so i do not end up like my father who has progressive supranuclear palsy a lot of salmonella to enter my brain and consume degenerated brain cells liver and eggs No, it's the other way around Parasites can eat more toxic cells then bacteria does and in so are faster in detoxing When the environment is too toxic parasites don't manifest.. Thus, bacteria and virus work.. If they don't get the job done, them cancer forms",5,191
4400,"Is raw milk the only choice of milk recommend ?. Or are other milks like “whole milk” or “A1, A2” a good alternative?. I think parasites start working after bacteria is too toxic Yea, i was thinking cancer might be different from tumors because people get all sorts of cancers like bone and blood but it is still the same mutated cells doing their thing.. My bad, thanks for catching me same thing thanks, so yeah, it seems like cancer = tumors to me He talks about cancer and it takes 5 pages we'll give you a basic income, but you must consent to being tracked/vaxxed etc i got a lot of nice bacteria this morning As long as it is raw it doesn't matter, A1, A2, whole milk.. Pasteurized milk is no longer milk anymore, just poison.. Soy is deadly Yes, chickens fed soy is a problem, affects the taste, and poisons you long-term Skin is the only think you cant have perfect on primal diet because most of the toxins leave true the skin, so our body always needs oils to protect it, washing it off makes it worse for the skin agree You know i noticed that i feel better after showering with regular water that werent heated with an electric heater but if for example i shower with water that were heated with an electric heater i don't feel that ""relaxing shower after effect"" it seems like if its heated it is full of electric charge.. I think showering once a week in a hot climate can be enough On mewing, I simply can't hold my tongue posture, or a straight body posture for long.. My body gets tired very quickly.My muscles are weak, but also very tense, got lots of tensions reading it currently, but haven't yet find an explanation of that, should be further then.. thanks tho I think this is written in a book.. Aajonus would say to drink juices because those who would do it were better of then those who did not so he was obviously talking from experience.. It also supply vitamins, minerals, enzymes in some people the alkalinity of some juice is needed to fight off over toxins in the blood hi guys, does anyone have a clue why do we need a vegetation in form of vegetable juice as aajonus said.. i mean, why do we need vegetation at all?. since we are carnivorous, what's the point in it?. I'd like to hear any thoughts, ty I just found out most store bought eggs even pasture raised are fed a high Soy diet.... is this a problem????Are they still ok to eat if organic or pasture raised.. Aajonus would tell before an operation where they dont want you to eat that you can eat raw eggs because they digest fast and wont cause any problems.. It is a mandatory to do it every year.They tell that you can't eat anything 4 hours before",17,495
4401,"Blood test for what purpose?. Thats the next step Now follow your instincts and become free, live and breathe in the countryside.. Yes This is a weird phenomenon that I've noticed has progressed after about a year of eating raw primal.. I have developed a highly heightened sense of sounds.... It is almost as things have a more thorough level of noise than they did previously.. But, this has been a downfall as well due to living in our modern society.. Unnatural sounds such as vacuum cleaners, chainsaws, rattling pots & pans, construction, etc.... These type of sounds have become more amplified and painful to be around.. My theory is that as you start eating a more natural diet that aligns with nature, these man made unnatural noises tend to affect you more.. Damn Try your best to find non soy fed eggs",10,143
4402,But what is the motivation behind it.. For drugs ?. Tomorrow I am having blood test at work.Should I eat something for breakfast?. The detox is heavy at night in a raw diet,4,33
4403,"You could not breath true your nose ?. If i use soap that makes it even worse, i stopped using it long time ago Your head will become a box https://youtu.be/Za1jKj5qxSk and btw try to maintain a ""sucction hold"" or intra-oral vaccum It’s probably a combination between diet, tongue posture and genetics.. Been following the Mews for a couple of years now, they’re definitely on to something.. But mewing still wont fix some of the problems with teeth ahahhaha, no, it's not only about lower jaw, but maxilla moves forward and you maintain a ""forward grown face"" an example this one it should, because crooked teeth is caused by lack of mouth space and dental arch width, there is just not enough space in mouth for teeth Yes, facial muscles don't move, tongue does the work Aajonus mewed right, but he didn't understand the procces, tho did it intuitively For example too big of space between the teeth, teeth who are facing too forwards In the past, I couldn't mew because i couldn't breathe while mewing1.3y on primal and my airways and throat have expanded, my facial bones have also expanded.. Now I can begin mewing I'll legit become a viking i know i heard about mewing a few years ago.. And now i just keep the tongue on the top of my mouth all the time it turns out my wisdom tooth has not been removed and i did not have any problems of it https://youtu.be/tE9u5QByE0E I will try to find, but I'm actually only in beginning phase now i see, fine by the way, I found one sphere where Aajonus most likely is wrong: in one video of Ebrahim's, he was talking about Weston Price (this one: https://youtu.be/yIm9ucmH2vc) and there he said that width of jaw is genetically determined, however in fact it is dependent upon the oral posture, initial diet (tough food to chew to build up jaw muscles) and most importantly postion of the tongue.. so the growth of face, crooked or not teeth etc are more environmentally guided rather than genetically as he says.. google ""Mewing"" or ""Orthotropics"" if you are interested in topic.. it was same life-changing thing for me as primal diet, so just recommending I notice this too and I’m only eating primal since February.. My sleep quality and length suffer (neighbor walking around, building site next door, church bells...), but the diet keeps me able to feel sharp the whole day anyway.. This is why allowing a baby to self feed “solid” foods rather than spoon feed them puree is 100x better.. Proper Initial oral development exactly and brest feeding is needed to maintain a right swallow pattern and i remember aajonus said how he drinks liquids, will try to find that video, it's actually the right swallow pattern like the one you have when mew Also breastfeeding your children can impact jaw structure.. Bottle feeding does not develop the jaws the way the breast does",13,495
4404,"@leofriskey how did you form the habit of mewing in the beginning?. I think he meant that when he traveled around those tribes who ate raw meat they had different jaw structures some wide some, different shapes of face with straight teeth and those people where on the right way of eating you need to build jaw muscles (to support the contrary-pushing tongue) by chewing tough gum and to do ""tongue chewing"" (video on orthotropics channel) It is easy just keep the tongue on the top of your mouth, you will get used to it Any health problem.. Cancer, etcIn the aluminium factory they don't let us enter without an ok blood test.And they are ours only client.. I'll chew brisket / beef breast muscle Yes :) there will always be ""strings attached"" look at Native Americans, their faces are short and wide, forward grown, they had primal diet oh, yeah, should've missed that, ty What is mewing?. Redpill me please Making tongue rest on the roof of mouth https://youtu.be/-qaVGR68FKY this video sums it up pretty decent",5,177
4405,"What was the thing about vit D getting washed away if one showers?. Any truth to that?. Was it not that the showers washes off the protective oils I could, but couldn't breathe through my nose if I put tongue on the roof of mouth Yes this, but how about after tanning showering",3,53
4406,"The vitamin D is fat soluble vitamin so when you wash of oils from your skin the body uses the nearest oils who have vitamin D in them to remake the oils ?. Nice vid.. I guess it’s time to mew 🐱 Also Aajonus said to rub cold pressed coconut oil on skin, my friend did that and still got burned really bad so I'm not sure how good it is as a sunblock spread Good thing i hate showering because i always get a discomfort when i get out of it.. Even from primal baths.. Only place where i don't feel too much of discomfort is from swimming in lakes.. Or showering in cold water well, i put my word in showering too.... there is some point in showering with soap only once at week maximum in other days - only water I noticed that if i shower it sort of removes a bit of my tan for sure i have a feeling that mewing works best on primal diet because of restructure and regeneration are maintained, so it's more easy for bones to relocate and grow But when I switched to raw fats I had no issue this video covers almost all you need to know about breathing right: https://youtu.be/mBqGS-vEIs0 it happens when jaw is pushed way too back blocking the airway or if it is simply too narrow my little brother can't mew because of that and speaking of breathing, i have one more tip i know, which complements the mewing, is ""buteyko breathing technique"" just google if you are interested could help solve a lot of breathing problems like asthma etc.",7,275
4407,"Basically holding your breath ?. Breathing less ?. Thank you for good information vilt💪.. I have issues eating rendered fat or fat that has been cooked e.g beef tallow, ghee, etc not really, breathing small portions at a time and more slowly takes time to master I remember how in excercises i was teached to breath true the diaphragm so it moves up and down yeah, thats too you need to breath through your diaprhagm, so the belly moves",4,79
4408,"yea, what is that all about ?. because breathing like that activates more lung volume than breathing by chest it turns on parasympathetic system and other stuff that, or restrictions will be placed Degenerations passes trough generation watch Pottengers cats.. Other factors than nutrition include emf toxicity and chemcial toxicity.. Yes.. We are now comunists 🙈 Floats because of the undigested fibre ?. What do you think.. What’s the difference between fecal matter that sinks in from the one that float ?. 😶 this is Snapchat you can judge me... but let’s not normalize meds The health of male shouldn't be ignored at all.In terms of passing qualities to children, it can be said that the male brings in the construction blueprints and the placenta is the architect choosing which genes get expressed and carried onwards from the ones that are presented.Poor blueprints means that however healthy the mother is the placenta can't formulate a healthy child if the blueprints are wrong from the start salmonella My friends little sister has brain cancer😔 LOL Also France n Germany planning ""corona-bonds"" its all about the collateral.. Yeah I've been curious about that too",10,192
4409,"@antonleiton i heard spain is planning a basic income !?. 450 -1200.- ?. O I think is mostly wife health and toxicity because child grows in the womb and feeds of what his mother eats, but if a child eats cooked foods he is going to degenerate either way.. Then he drinks mothers milk too so there goes another part as to why it is more female related.. But i will have to look in to more of pottengers experiments.. 👍For example, if you are 3-rd generation processed, cooked food male...does that mean you sperm is going to pass some degenerations, or it's mostly about your wife health?. Also vice versa ..... Yes, and to counteract the cooked foods we were raised with.After few years, depending on the individual, the quantity of vegetable juice may be lowered.. Yes , brain tumor has to be from vaccine.. That's sad yes, seem to be this way (imo) or even both parts.. So if viruses can't deal with toxic ,dead cells any more than body makes cancer cells as a last resort .. When babies and small kids get diagnosed with cancer, is this vaccines related or do they get all the toxins from mother before they are born?. They are not old enough to get it trough food..... The taxes will increase, universal income is like self sabotage SSRI’s have ruined a generation .. Complete robots I’ve thought about this tooWhen I hate fiber my poo float Pure meat, eggs and butter diet my pooSink in and it’s rabbit size matter 🤓😂",15,260

I guess butter was available all the time You are like aajonuspedia 👍🏻Thanks Yes because my digestion is much better and it's easier to swallow fish for me i haven't even finished the book yet:)just remembered that moment of him saying this Good memory.I should have a lot of toxins from vaccines in the brain.I don't remember much about my childhood,6,136

Was eating for 2 weeks 2lbs a day and couldn’t put on muscle at all.. Switched to local organic grass fed immediate results.. Who knows what’s in that Sprouts stuff i've eaten it very lightly cooked i think they use antibiotics up until 3 months to slaughter or something I think they freeze it too ..

I was taking some acv from that jar before, so that yeast fall down and acv colony was making new layer all the time.. yep, delicious Nah, our every day fridge, only think we don't use it any longer ;) so there is only some fermented stuff for experimentation.. Liver jar inside, I don't have any mold growth yet ~ 2 months old beef liver and one jar of beef heart England’s finest i tried to combine muscle meat with raw honey for fermentation.. it was producing a lot of gases in the beginning.. taste was really awful.. I also do a lot of other experiments, but i don't wanna talk about it now because I'm not done yet.. When I gather some interesting data, I'll shared it with you guys in this channel ofc.. I fermented liver like that, it was fantastic, no mold inside.. Now i also ferment 3 jars of liver in the AV way (I ""air"" them every 2-3 days) to see the difference.. Well you should give it a try and see how it goes.. Yea, mold grows always when there is some oxygen inside the jar.. Same thing with fermenting veggies, if you don't want any mold there just put some airlock on that jar.. Btw when i was doing fermented veggies years ago, most of the time i was doing it exactly like AV was doing his high meat.Why i was doing it like that ?. Because i was lazy and it was the easiest way to make fermented veggies ;) just put e.g.. some carrots inside the jar, cover it with water and then mix on the surface every 2-3 days to prevent mold from growing to much on that surface.. Bacteria won't progress that way because they won't be able to metabolise.. Same thing with fermenting veggies, if you try to make e.g.. fermented pickles and you close the lid tight, it will increase the pressure inside and worse fermentation process.. Fermenting meat releases less gasses, so it's not affecting it that much like veggies, but still the bacteria would like to ""breathe"".. I don't think so mate, i disagree with him on many things ;) The best way would be to do it exactly like ppl ferment veggies (e.g.. with some airlock lids), because it's the same fermentation process.So why AV ""aired"" it that way ?. Well AV was on his own lvl of doing things, I think he did that way because he wanted some mold growth inside as well.Sandor Katz wrote some nice materials about fermentation process, doesn't matter that he talked mostly about veggies, you can use his knowledge also to ferment animal products.",26,501

Didnt expect that, but I dont have a klantenpas anyway.. sounds good You pay 1 euro for 1L of raw milk.. Noord-Hollands hof in Spijkerboor!. It’s a 20 min bike ride from my house, has grass-fed meats, pasture raised eggs and only A2 dairy products (raw milk, kefir, yogurt, cheeses and even ice cream).. It’s heaven on earth",23,295

I’ve read it can lead to inflammation, fibrosis and collagen build up in liver and tissues.. It has to be broken down by the liver and wastes glycogen whilst doing this.. It helped me too, raw yoghurt is awesome @sjon You can buy raw butter at the Sligro, but it's not always available.@naomi Are you sure it's all A2 milk?. Good to know then..

Nobody likes talking to an s Enjoy the real world Never ever Yes I get many issues and symptoms with dairy I ate alot of pasteurized dairy when I was little and now I can't eat even raw butter No go, it will just poison your system and collect in your tissue and whenever you would eat raw foods or raw milk you would have discomforts and bloating when the raw foods will bind with them and detox.",2,80
4506,"hi guys, what do you think about non-raw butter and cream?. @M1ksu i get white tongue when i drink milk too and because i drink it every day i have white tongue every day after i stop drinking it the white tongue disappear.. But i know that milk is particularly good at binding with toxins and i don't worry that much about it.. It seems as the time goes on it gets smaller and smaller.",4,75
4507,"Milk in the sense of minerals is still on the top, calves have to build bones when they grow up, some places have to harden and they need huge amounts of it.. You think meat has a lot of minerals ?. never gotten white tongue after eating oysters or meat",3,50
4508,"Like what ?. Oysters ?. so does a lot of other foods Milk is has a lot of minerals.. A lot of people associate white tongue with candida or eating carbs.. Especially since you start raw primal your body is detoxing from the mouth , especially from the gums and tongue.. Because our brain is made of fat, that's where most of the toxins go.. White tongue is minerals binding with the toxins and exiting true the tongue.. You get dry mouth because your body is using all the fat in the nearby cells for detoxing and binding with toxins, you are not eating enough fat or butter.. To fix the problem eat a piece of butter or any other fat until dry mouth disappears.I have white tongue since i started primal, dry mouth too.. These remedies that i talked about fixes dry mouth.. For white tongue it takes time, slowly over time the detox gets smaller and smaller then disappears.. Eating accordingly could speed up the process.. This information comes from Q&A and other Aajonus sources.Carbs like fruits increases detoxification.. If I just eat meat, butter, eggs it doesn't happen but it's weird cause it's just milk that does this Yea, AV talked about this too when people have white tongue that means that toxins are being expelled true the mouth using minerals Start with fermented dairy like raw yogurt or soured cream after scrubbing it off smell dissapears it's possible I drink milk and there is no smell, even with food stuck.. And i drink sometimes up to 3L per day.. Mouth is a big dumping ground in terms of toxins and maybe they can cause the smell because the milk could pull them out of your tissues.. Make perfect sense 😂 so i think it's like: ""my teeth are clean but still bad breath"" - in this case it's toxification he himself cleaned teeth with coconut cream makes sense, thanks if I don't drink milk it won't smell then I drink milk and after one day breath smells again like if I brush my teeth and tongue all smell goes away It can also be caused by food stuck in between teeth and food stuck to your tongue This is the one thing aajonus was wrong about It is interesting when other species(fish, birds...)  die in large amount , They never say that one ate some chinese shit and sneezed and all other got sick and died...They always say it's from industrial polution.. Only for humans this doesn't apply.... True story,  in 2014 I did a class called ""the history of the philosophy of science"" In this class the point was that there was no such thing as absolute truth,  to me that means science can exist for fun but it can't be something to govern our lives by Because people blind themselves with “science” I've just noticed that after drinking milk there's this white plaque type thing on my tongue that smells bad Go slowly But they make me burp I can only get raw milk here and I make kefir from it, raw butter or cream is impossible to get So basically all those issues I had where symptoms of detox But the amount of it in the raw kefir is little and it happens naturally.. Alcohol is a solvent, it was used in the past by the industry as a solvent So you saying alcohol is a solvent Raw Kefir is more detoxing then raw milk because of bacteria and alcohol level who is used by the body as solvent in it So start slow with raw yogurt , obviously I’m not saying listen to me I’m only sharing my own experience but everyone is different, what works for me might not work for your situation Thank you I see Especially from someone who has a dysfunctional gut flora Kefir makes me bloated Some people have very hard die off reactions to kefir But kefir is too strong at first Can I eat more than one tablespoon of yogurt kefir is even better than yoghurt Yes raw yoghurt is so rich in probiotics and easy to handle for raw dairy The message is for salty Oops sorry my bad No matter if I go slow And get bloated I tried alot of things You can make raw cream or raw butter from milk if it is whole But you’d need so many litres of milk To make a big supply of butter and cream",20,750
4509,"Are you eating raw dairy straight from the fridge?. i know but then there is no cream in the milk anymore and i still get the same amount of fat then So that's why I'm having alot of symptoms cause I eat alot of dairy try a teaspoon of milk a day and slowly build or first eat raw yogurt and soured cream of you can get it and then I think it may be easier to drink milk and eat butter How slow should I go tho That’s how I did it myself but everyone is different, but it worked for me Cream fat and butter fat are different.. Cream is a lot harder to digest.. I get about 15L per week and there is always some left for cream and little bit for butter.. But yea it is better to buy raw butter.. i think you answered the wrong person  phil You have to go slow and take your time.. Raw milk or raw butter will slowly remove the pasteurised milk from your tissues and you will be able to drink a lot more later.",7,187

I’ve found no research proving that dietary iron can cause iron overload.. Only supplements Now sheep brains, that was amazing.. The effect was pretty good.. When i butchered an animal myself i did not see any difference when i drank it.. Was pretty salty too hard to drink a lot of it.. I did not feel any benefits later on.. Had a little herbal taste to it.. I rather give it to plants I remember him saying that blood should not supply the nutrients but lymphatic system does.. Blood is only for oxygen supply.. +1.. wonder too",14,128
4515,"Did aajonus ever talk about drinking blood?. Seems like it would be the most primal way to get minerals?. Of course, it can taste like a completely different food if fully fermented Salt is a poison, it kills a lot of healthy cells.. It can also amplify pain and make you heal slower.. There is nothing good in it to consume it.. That is why everything on primal is raw and unsalted.. 2006 09 10 03:17:35Masai don't like doing it and they do it only 3 months a year.. They would drink milk mixed with blood 50/50 as soon as the calfs are not suckling anymore they stop eating the blood and go right back to eating milk.. ya i know Weird.. I had brain before and didn‘t notice anything really plenty of cheese though with it Idk I sometimes crave fresh, sometimes sour.. I think it's both good They have two different ones..

When I’m home I make it myself That's clabbered milk Didn't know that it wasn't real kefir, makes sense though When I drank their kefir I got headaches from it Idk about the yoghurt from rauwpower but their kefir isn't real kefir.. They don't make it with real kefir grains, but use some powder.. Just so everyone knows.. And it's way too expensive.. why u not make it yourself i never buy youghurt Weird that they say that, whenever I’m in the Netherlands I get yogurt from Rauw Power which is sold in many stores and is definitely not pasteurized When they make kombucha first they boil it which makes it toxic on its own, and add processed sugar which is a free radical that causes problems.. >drinking alcohol",7,130

Sometimes I eat the grains and feel fine Reading comments like this make me realize that our bodies know it’s not so natural to cook, but very misguided lol a lot of probiotics , gut/brain connection but also drank some other alcohol I don’t know if it’s mental but I always feel really energised after drinking kefir.. I always gat raw A2 kefir from a farm called Ecoboerderij de Haan for the people in NL, they have amazing stuff perhaps that is why i vomitted this morning (if this point exists at all) I want to eat this https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/found-a-2000yearold-22pound-still-edible-hunk-of-bog-butter i mean to the point you should avoid it",4,111
4518,"so basically any raw food in primal diet doesn't age?. i drank hard (alcoholic) kombucha last night i just had no troubles consuming it, funny, will take in mind, ty Whenever i would add honey to milk it would have different taste when it fermented and i did not like it.. So i eat them separately and mix it in my mouth.. honey will faster ferment milk why I don't add honey at all i just take a bit of honey and fermented milk and mix it in my mouth to drink it I was there once but everything they gave me was frozen (cream, sheep milk, cow’s milk...) I just let the milk sit outside the fridge for one or two days it gets clabbered so i just mix it up and drink it with honey.. Unfermented raw milk is always harder on my digestion and i would not be able to drink 3L of it per day if it was unfermented.. The bacteria predigest it for me.. First i craved unfermented raw milk but now i only crave fermented raw milk.. The cravings changed over time and i think it will for you.. Unfermented raw milk makes the digestion a little bit harder on me and i can't drink a lot of it.. Anyone watching the sverige stream?. He mentioned a butcher in Bussum that sells many organs",11,230

Cheese has 8times more minerals than milk Fats like butter or cheese make my mouth dry and I feel thirsty.I also have bad smell and a little halitosis I stopped the process keeping it outside because the smell was stinky poop poo.. But i will try later some time .. Also i was keeping a lid on it so it would be moist and ideal place for mold to grow.. He can try letting it during day on the fridge an out in the night to speed up the process.. But I prefer it on the fridge.. It's sweeter I wouldn’t bother buying eggs from supermarkets either, e.g in the uk they are obliged to inject the eggs to prevent salmonella that’s why you see those red lion labels imprinted I've eaten wild eggs that were yellow and very tasty.. The color is not always the one to look for I'm amazed how much things you can say about the book you didn't red 😲 I have access to organic eggs from my uncles chickens.. No all are orange.. I will take photos Makes sense It depends on your other options",11,202

And better than bottled water for meBut always better raw.. Of course",8,65
4521,What do you mean ?. I eat a little Pasteurised butter sometimes when I see some clients on restaurants and don't have problemsI have problems with uht milk and with bottled waterAnd I don't have problems drinking raw milk now.. 1-2l everyday.. A year ago I had to drink it after 1 day in the fridge,4,56
4522,What symptoms did you used to get with the milk?. I don't think that is a good logic to have.. You can drink coffee too and don't feel any ill effects on the start.. Slowly even little amounts built up to be big amounts and in the long term.. I would never recommend anyone to consume pasteurised dairy.. Especially of it is known ill effects.. Good thing you eat raw and your body can deal with the little amount you eat.. So I can see why AV stays away from organic labels It depends on the other options.. For my omnivorous children Pasteurised butter is a medicine For us is a little poison.. But I prefer it than bottled water.. But I am not recommending eating it to a primal guy.. Only telling that there are another worse thingsOnly a teaspoon of coffee killed me for all day long Can you not get your kids raw butter ?. Why do you have to choose between butter or bottled water ?. Some people have different sensitivity and can feel cooked foods effects while some don't.. It was only an example to explain that raw butter doesn't kill you but will not help you improve your health.. But is less poison than another foods Maybe not well explained,16,216
4523,"Where are you from?. He should know the effects either way and decide himself he already know that people drink it.. Even if he can't find raw dairy or butter i am sure he can find frozen raw butter or get it shipped to him.. There is always an option to eat raw.. Especially because we know the effects of it and it should be promoted.. If he would eat pasteurised dairy his body would have to leech nutrients to help bind with toxins and there would be more loss then gain.. And in a sense we are helping each other to stay on the right course and to always be looking for a better option No pasteurised cream or milk is a poison, that will make you have problems later when you drink raw milk or other raw foods.. Pasteurised dairy collects toxins and redistributes it back to the body.. The toxic minerals end up deposit in the body too that later have to be detoxified by raw milk.. It is not food anymore I wish it was as easy thanks bro I bought organic eggs and it’s yellow in the inside, the yolk is supposed to be orange Maybe for organs not that great but for meat and fat yea..

Also fish caught in the shore is a lot more polluted and you should go for not shore caught fish.. About that current bring toxins he said that air force was experimenting on tribes in alaska and bombing them with chemicals from the air.. And they are blaming it on currents because no one is admitting on what they are doing.. Fish in Alaska are the least contaminated fish, if you analyse it in a lab as supposed to japan.. They are lying to hide away how those Alaskan natives were poisoned.. In canada is the same thing they blame it on some currents, but canada is mining uranium and all those tribes are sick and can't work because of those mining operations.. And on all those cold climate fish test showed only 4% to 5% is polluted.. Also take in consideration that Aajonus would eat a lot of fish so he did not worry about that.. They could already have done some experiments on people in Scandinavia or other places and blame it on currents againYou can listen yourself just search pollution in the list of topics pdf..

To prove his case And on these things too Yea, this is one variable, that they didn't assume in ""Our Stolen Future"".. Eating raw protects againts these things (I hope).. They did plenty of tests and studies.. Just read the book pls and tell me what you think about it, coz it was life changing for me when i red it.. That was one of the reasons i switched from cooked carnivore to raw food.. I see, i wanted to get some artic fish but i guess i will pass Do they talk about those tests, studies ?. Will i find them in a book ?. Does that mean that artic fish is toxic ?. So the current get all those chemicals in the the artic ocean and then they stay there ?. I remember Aajonus talking how land is 20% polluted but only 4% is oceans.. Like most of the usa freshwater lakes contains some sort of poison I also realized that running away from urban areas to ""clean"" and ""untouched"" by the industry areas like Syberia may not be the best way to stay healthy.I think that the best way to avoid pollution and stay healthy atm is to do it AV style:1.. Continual external detox (hot baths)2.. Continual internal detox (cheese, cream + blueberry, ousters, cilantro juice etc) I'd really like to know AV thoughts about the data and studies Theo Colborn placed in her book.. It seems so incredible and the research isn't new, but every time when I talk to anyone that knows something about these toxins, they all confirm it.. I don't know about the southern areas, but PCBs travel north..

There is only a fermented milk everywhere in the world and there are thousands names in local language to describe it.. Food industry took few local names like over ~100 years ago (e.g..

I get problems from cold milk Wolfs and lions don't drink water like we do, they lick it with their tongue, try to do it yourself and see how what you could do it.. They don't gulp it down like we do.. They drink water from rivers and lakes, full of bacteria.. And they can go without drinking for some time like people in tribes can.. People in the past were not drinking as much water as people do now, they have been brainwashed by bottled water companies that they have to drink 8 cups a day.. Whenever i would drink water fast or gulp it down i can feel the difference which it causes.. Raw foods have so much bioavailable water already in them.. When we drink tap water our body has to use nutrients to make it bioavailable.. I take out my raw milk out every morning and leave it at room temp for 3-6 hours Then drink it or eat the cream and yoghurt",10,177
4539,"I have a question.. How come people who drink water from foreign countries get sick and have diarrhea ?. What’s the explanation?. What kind of water ?. Tap water ?. There is this naturally sparkling water who has a lot of minerals, and on its packaging it says that it can cause diarrhoea.. Good minerals can bind with toxins and maybe in so the outcome could be diarrhoea.. Tap I guess, I always hear people drinking water from Mexico and getting sick And makes sense Or it could be spicy Mexican food there are so many variables.. People body can start a detoxification based on humidity and temperature.. Like it is with malaria It says it on this water.. It is naturally sparkling.. That’s confusing to me, as Aajonus repeats often, water isn’t good.. We should get it from fat.. Yet wolves and lions drink plenty of water and are obligatory carnivores yeah, british people look sick, even actors like Benedict Cumberbatch (tho i like him) there’s also wisdom from the pottenger cat study book",14,175

Impressed 5-6 days There were more , but I couldn't listen to all I also forgot to mention that I heard that when some wild bears would hunt for food by catching salmon in the rivers, if there is salmon roe inside they tend to eat all of the salmon roe and then throw the meat leftovers to scavengers so that goes to show that it is treasure food https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5JMrwkFU4g Similar to organ meats like liver.. E.g when a pack of lions or wolfs would go out to hunt their prey, the leader or “alpha” so to speak, would always get the liver which was deemed to be the prize Phil In Finland, there's a few hunting stories of hunters illegally hunting and then getting a suspicion they might get caught, the eldest informs to ""grab the liver!"" and run away.. This happened sometime during 1900's.Also, according to folk tales, fish roe was generously given to pregnant women during pregnancy because it was viewed as highly nutritious, and priced food.. The bit you said about fish roe given to pregnant women, I heard that aswell when I was in Ukraine, my grandma told this too.. So true It's interesting and horrifying to see how much the average Western diet has changed in the last 100 years.. I suspect with the current and ever increasing industrial pollution and EMF's if the modern young adults eat a plant-based diet in 2 generations they could easily be infertile.. They’re already thinking of making lab made meat, average people will taste it and then say it taste just like meat and then vegans may have a stronger claim for animal rights",14,929

4584,"If you want to detox from, say, vaccines, does it make sense to make high vaccinated meat, because it will grow bacteria and molds that digest the toxins of vaccines?. @malownn Depends on the individual what kind of health they have @Sytze I don't remember Aajonus discussing that, some others may remember if he said something on it.But berries, moldy berries, along with some herbs are absolutely the best for chelating with heavy metals from vaccines and industrial toxins.. No that don't make sense.. The problem with vaccines is two things.. First the toxic chemicals and heavy metals, second the altered virus and foreign tissue which the body don't recognize.. When the virus and foreign tissue gets injected in the body it bypasses the body's natural defenses.....",6,127
4585,"But if you want molds that break down a certain toxin doesn't is make sense to ferment that toxin?. Do high vitamin A foods cause burning sensation in back of throat?. Liver does it for me, and now I'm eating raw shrimp heads and I'm getting it @malownn The mold cleanses you by feeding off of degenerated tissue, eating off dead nerves, chelating with heavy metals, just like parasites feed off of degenerated tissue.. Eggs.Meat1 day old milk thx!. you read a lot of interesting stuff 👍 not really i will try more cheese YesAnd it burnt my esophagus like hell",5,101
4586,"Thanks 👍🏻Same with cream, cheese and butter?. Don't know about that , you could listen that part yourself.. He talked about milk so cream could probably go in to that Uhhhh noo Because it contracts the stomach and as a consequence causing the milk to irritate the system (From this vid33:22 - 34:14).. You don't need a full cup Fresh milk helps me to poop more often It's not ""artists"" it's secret services, they run the whole ""entertainment industry"".. Read Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon: Laurel Canyon, Covert Ops & the Dark Heart of the Hippie Dream by David McGowan or at least some Mark Devlins materials.",5,107
4587,"What were you eating ?. Cold milk makes the body not digest it fast enough so it passed to the blood undigested.. Any cold food can shrink the stomach, but milk causes the problem because it is a liquid.. But cold food in general slows down the digestion.. how long it took with primal to fix it You think authors wanted him to make a foreword ?. A lot of her research was academic funded (public money), so ""educational system"" had a lot to say about the way it was published.Second, the foreword was put there not to encourage ppl to read the book, because most sheeples don't read at all.. One of the reasons of that foreword was to scare potential readers.. Other reason would be to say in a hidden language ""Look what we did and you can't do shit about it.. Silent Spring didn't stop us and this book also won't stop us.. You just obey.."" I fixed it before primal.. Not mixing different types of food.. And avoiding starchs hmm mine is not being fixed even on primal been almost 1 month , a lot of burping that is stuck in esophagus causing trouble swallowing/breathing",12,199

4589,"Anyone here try Aajonus’s Penicillin Destroyer formula and have success with Crohn’s or other conditions?. its another story when its injected... Yeah I definitely won't try it myself.. But I was thinking similar to how they make antivenom by injecting venom into animals, maybe we can make antitoxins by giving toxins to animals and creating a biome against those toxins From what I know, only organic matter ferments, industrial toxic waste decomposes in a different way.. I heard that mold can dissolve some of that waste, but not everything.2-3 years ago i went to Józef Krop lecture, he had a meeting with professionals EM producers, I asked them about newly produced industrial toxins, because i heard that these toxins are indestructible in nature, they told that we need to wait few years for the nature to produce new bionom that will be able to handle these new toxins, because similar situation was with ""Agent Orange"".. It took few years to start decomposing that thing in nature.So ""training"" microbiom to handle some nasty toxins may be a good idea, but you'd need some experienced lab professional to do it, because doing it in ""home made"" way may not be a good idea ;) Here in Saudi it’s very common to sell camel pee for skin diseases and a lot swear by it There's so much wisdom that makes sense from Aajonus-perspective Pissing on a fresh wound Inflammation or swelling is combatted by applying pig poop or cow poop Herpes goes away by rubbing it with saliva in the morning Burn is also helped with having a piss filled gauze on it or cow shit I found a Finnish folk belief that says: ""For a burn, a raw egg helps."" Me too.. And bloating/muscle loss I eat frozen liver, tasted pretty great and makes me feel good 90 percent of the stuff I eat is previously frozen, I'm  doing great Using fresh warm milk for skin diseases I’d rather eat the frozen meat than what vegans are eating on a daily basis Of course it’s not the same as fresh I agree, ( I only eat fresh myself) but if its better than nothing Well we already give toxins to animals.. Antibiotics, vaccines.. Maybe it helps somehow Maybe that's also why we don't get mercury from raw fish I remember somewhere aajonus said fish with mercury actually helps you detox mercury Didn't make sens to me at all then but now it does Mercury in the fish is completely different, it is an organic mercury with its natural bonds that fish needs to float.. Yes Mercury is in vaccines Liver from grass fed beef, soy free chicken, previously frozen n probably vaccinated but Gets me high.. Shrimp is wild caught, previously frozen If that’s the only option then it’s better than nothing Have you read what vaccines are made of ?. It is chemicals and heavy metals.. I don't think doing that will help.. You could train yourself to certain venoms but this is not a natural organic venom, it is an industrial chemical",14,512
4590,"or u trying to get high?. Yes he was against all forms of fasting, he said you have to eat some protein every 5 hours at least (even at night) because otherwise you would go into autophagy and start eating your own toxic meat.. apparently you can decarboxylate fresh cannabis with citric acid (orange juice) so u can keep it primal that way if you like Sexy",3,67
4591,"was AV against intermittent fasting?. oh, fine, thanks I had frozen fat that was good tasting from grass-fed cows Over a long period of time the fat will do deep tissue cleansing, but by consuming fermented cannabis juice you'll get it much quicker out of your system",2,47

Worse months ago Cheese train solve it It is bad to smoke it because of tars, one joint is like a pack of cigarettes, it crystallizes in the lungs and arteries and could cause problems later on.. If you are planing on doing it chew it for as long as you can, more then 20 minutes or longer to activate the thc.. The high should last a few days.. That what you should do if you are planning on doing it.. That is what AV said about it.. Never tried, it don't know..

4596,"so you only eat fruit?. Nope, has no taste to it Thanks Sveikas deividai When it’s hot and I’m thirsty, I do enjoy a few sips of cold milk, works a lot better than water for me Nice to know brotha 2007 09 29 05:10:30 Frozen fish as long as that fish is from colder environment in the ocean, salmon, not trout, trout doesn't do well frozen it is a freshwater fish, swordfish is fine frozen, tuna, all those will be okay frozen.. I did not see them create any kind of ill effect with animals.. But your red meat, veal, sheep, your normal goat not mountain goat all those meat frozen will cause some deterioration of the animals that eat it.",4,122
4597,"Thoughts on weed?. These is the Opposite to aajonus experiences Me.. At 8-9°C It is better to eat frozen then not to eat at all (starving-fasting).. Starving is the worst thing you can do, besides eating salt especially in today's world.. AV talked how frozen fish from cold climates is ok because it did not create any ill effects on animals, but we should still strive to eat not frozen",5,70
4598,"how much raw mik do I need to make enough raw cream?. You can’t even claim that we know they ate once in a while either We already know that fasting is retarded, so by default eating as often as you want is ideal i just mean, babies are literally in ketosis on breastfeeding and it's narural body's state, like even brain prefers ketons etc.... and i i basically just wondering if AV ever talked about this - and if not - why I agree that eating often is better but I think that going without food whilst sleeping or 10 hours ain’t going to have a significant impact on lifespan Point is the fuss about fasting is too much, it’s a minor thing, the result of doing a bit of it is not going to have a significant impact or make a big difference But it won’t reduce lifespan Don’t know for sure either or, never been studied My grandmas brother in Ukraine is 87, he doesn’t eat every 5 hours and he does not fast for 24 hours or more, he just eats breakfast and dinner  and a late snack before bed He still rides his bike.. He goes on walks, and looks after his goats, chickens, cats and dogs Okay but just because many didn’t eat very often what does it tell you if an individual did eat often ?. It means that they’re a good hunter What’s ur point that has no evolutionary sense if it's fair for very few individuals I think once in a while, yeah.. But if you do it forever it’s going to age you quicker because you deplete you’re nutrient stores and that means you have to eat more.. And eating ages you it’s not like you’re going to suffer Bad health if you don’t eat exactly after every 5 hours a person eating junk shit every 3 hours all day long will be much worse than a person who happens to be without food  till 12 noon but eats nutritious raw dairy and animals Everyday Yeah but I thought it’s assumed that we’re talking about raw animal products It is really easy, you have to have experience in animal hunting, or slaughtering to understand.. Once you kill an animal that is food, and you eat it whenever you want it until you see that you don't have too much left you go hunt again.. If we would be talking about optimal and the best solution it would be eat as much as you can.. You could catch some fish or gather some berries, there would be many solutions, you would not be sitting lazy all day  you would be doing something.. You could also carry some other foods like milk.. And what is more retarded is to force yourself to not eat(fasting).. Also you have to understand that you won't cure any disease or cancer by fasting(starving) there is no benefit to it.. Especially in today's toxic world we need nutrients and we need a lot of it to neutralise toxicity that surrounds us, from industrial chemicals to emf pollution our bodies has to work double the work.. We get poisoned when we are born by vaccines and other pollutants.. And because we know that our bodies uses fats and other nutrients to bind with toxins it is stupid to even ponder about not providing them because a lions doesn't do it, because we live in a different times.. If i don't eat for some time i already can feel the effects of it, i have to wake up at night and eat something because if i don't it will take for me some time until i can start to feel amazing again but sometimes it is hard.. that's a point, thx for explanation The cream rises to the top on its own Not good mkay, I’m living in a dorm next year... is there a way to attract someone who doesn’t find me crazy or possibly someone like minded what I mean is- what should I say in my roommate finder description You’re laid back and chilled, open minded ,  positive and happy meat lover🥩 Clever, thank u!",19,699

Once you have an animal you eat it whenever you want.. And there would be other foods that you could eat.. People could follow a huge animal herds that used to be in the past in terms of hundreds or even thousands of even more herbivores.. So the hunting would be even easier.. And either way we should choose what would be the best for us.. Hunter gatherer in the past would trip and hurt their legs so we should too ?. A lion would get kicked in the head when hunting zebras so we should too, maybe it is beneficial, you tread it ?. if you eat less than 50g of carbs per day you are in ketosis Dairy* Of course..

4606,"aren't you in ketosis consuming almost no carbs?. by the way, what were aajonus thoughts on ketosis?. couldn't find it in a book do you think lions or any other predators would eat every ~5 hours?. doubt that.. especially since we know that humans hunted in groups, it's hardly possible to make it over 3-4 times a day just standart mode of the body's metabolism So pollution started ages ago They just never lived in big cities.. It’s a big difference.. In their generations, people living in big cities were surrounded by industrial revolution Your grandmother's generation didn't have the +60,000 new toxins that have been introduced today.. We are at a point where toxins roaming around in industrial societies are already aging us far more and quicker than eating often.Thus, in industrial societies; eating often >>> fasting I get 1litre of cream out of 9l of milk on a good day..

The hard carrot fibre already destroys digestion when you eat raw meat ( because the amount of time it takes to pass true the digestion track) but you even add salt to make it poisonous ?. At least don't add the salt.. I don't understand why you people listen to ray peat he has nothing to do with health.. And if you eat root or other hard to digest fibre with animal products or raw meat it will cause you bloating.. I’m glad you’re here, I don’t understand the whole premise, there is a reason we drink veg, not eat Had my first raw chicken yesterday Is my second favourite after scallops Current gorging on scallops + Caviar <3 Sorry wrong group, we want the bacteria..

I just need a good raw liver source Honestly I thought Miller’s beef liver was nothing to write home about.. Not worth $15.. I’ve had much better liver locally for half the price Though Millers can be kinda hit/miss, sometimes their meat is amazing, sometimes it’s just ok.. So maybe I had one of the more ok livers Yeah I’m sure you’re right.. What sold me was that it was non vaccinated.. I live in Pennsylvania should I’m just gonna call a lot of places If you’re in PA I’d imagine you gotta be able to find something.. I’m sure there’s a butcher shop that sells local meat Fucking insane Eat high meat, that’s the moto, making some high chicken next, chicken and fish I can eat all day And because our guts are already toxic from all the pollution and poisons that have been fed and injected all our life we want to add the bacteria, because if they can't even reproduce on their own flushes would be even worse, to destroy a few that is left.. I would not even recommend that to my enemies.. Whenever i see someone recommend flushes i run away from him.. Flushes can turn mild depression to a severe one, and the ones who are recommending it are little devils wanting to cause more suffering.. While high meat cures depression instantly.. No sauerkraut or other fermented fibre will ever do it for you.. That is why people like to eat high meat and have been for thousands of years.. No proof that dietary iron causes issues That’s why I eat the bulk of fat from pig salo, I only eat dairy 2x week because I hate eating or drinking it after taking it out of the fridge.. I like it only fresh warm dairy especially squeezing the tit of the cow and drinking it on that same day I chilled unrefrigerated That’s why I said if you believe in evolution.. Open ur eyes Their ancestors were dinosaurs if you believe in evolution Chicken should not even eat grains in the best case scenario but it is not so bad compared to heavily proceeded feeds.. It has a gizzard to digest hard insects shells.. He should get the food from the forest, pastures and sometimes could be given raw meat and other scraps.. K, i‘ll see how i react to them.. Can‘t be sure they don‘t feed them soy tho Yes, but soy is not good at all.. Corn is fine for chicken.. The shell should be harder in perfect world.. And if the chicken would be raised optimally Wouldn‘t the shell be harder from healthy chicken?. To protect the baby chicks I found some local, supposedly soy and corn free eggs, but they have a very weak shell, doesn‘t seem good quality Chickens fed on raw milk and whey+grains Easy enough, the soy fed eggs had the hardest shells I've come across, they did get pasture access tho Of course, there is no need to get in to those kinds of talks.. I would choose fat over liver any time because i need it and our bodies need it too",30,675

Also don't we need protein to digest fat ?. But maybe the fat in animals already has protein in it.. 6 feet deep But in those videos Eskimos are eating raw liver first..

Animal fat is better then dairy or other fat in terms of its quality as a fat.. But what do you mean commercially raised ?. For poultry and eggs you should watch out for soy.. For other animals fat even if it would have toxins in it should just pass true as long as you eat it raw..

Raw primal makes me feel so much better, but I'm still pretty lazy and frequently have lots of apathy towards life in general.. But I also believe that another major contributing factor to this is living in a city.. I've realized in this past year more than ever how living in a city is extremely depressing and totally out of our natural element.. Constant loud machinery running, being around too much wifi/ cell towers, pollution, noisy traffic, surrounded by cooked food eaters/ restaurants, etc.. Even if you are in perfect health, this type of environment will drive you insane.. Here they give organic grass pastured beef fat trimmings for free, but the fat is kinda dry I think i also remember him saying somewhere in Q&A that toxins in the fats should just pass true when you eat them.. While sv3rige say other wise.. It is also simple to prove.. You give toxic fat to an animal and analyse his manure later to see the results.. Of course organic and naturally grown animal fat is the best and we should strive for it, but what do you do when you can't have it In England from a good source a rib eye steak costs £13 for just 350g Farmers rip you off for muscle meats Because otherwise it would be very expensive if you know what I mean I never said just buy meat alone and survive without the fat I think you Misunderstood what I meant bruh.. Sv3rige is basically saying what AV is saying about toxins being stored in the fat not the meat.. So what I’m saying is that you can buy e.g chicken breast that has virtually zero fat and eat it with e.g grass fed organic free range fat from animals i.e beef fat trimmings, salo pig fat, raw dairy..... You can't survive on meat alone.. You need fat with it.. What does he even know when he say these things, most of the things he say come from Aajonus that he puts a few of his spins on it without doing any research or experiments to back his claims.. You should not listen to what sv3rige has to say, but to AV.. You should go straight to the source.. As long as there’s no fat Sv3rige even said that you can get away with eating lean commercial meats I’d rather spend a good amount of money on quality fat than muscle meat",21,436

There were people who would when they started primal would be really lazy and there would be a few reasons..

Even if they say organic, that the soy has been fed organic they have to process it and use a chemical treatment, because raw soy kills any bird, any poultry.. Just like Raw soy will kill a human.. So it has to be solvent and heat treated so it is a highly processed food.. So i don't eat chickens that are fed a lot of soy nor eggs that are from chickens that are fed a lot of soy.. If is over 30-25% soy i don't touch the eggs or the chicken.. or because they woke up every night to eat instead of sleeping A lot of Ukrainian women crave salo when they get pregnant so it’s a staple Random local market in Ukraine * I find salt disgusting too, the food loses its flavour This whole convo just made my day 😂 People in this group eat cow shit, so I don't really see anything as off-limits They're full of nutrition and 0 carb so was checking it out Just a study on rat poop No agenda/big pharma/nutrition It's a study stating that rats have a certain worm, and they poop it out, and slugs/snails consume said worm I don't believe we should apply binary, completely mutually-exclusive blanket statements to how we live life My sister just saw that notification on my phone and then looks at me like as if I’m fucked up 😂😂😂  crying in tears I've also eaten snails, just not raw I belive measureable data in and of itself, is not theory ) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3689478/ But the worms won't eat your brain unless you are mega toxic Worm eggs can survive though https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3689474/ Sure brain eating worms lmao Anyway, no 🐌 My friends look at me weird just for eating steak raw with eggs....

Don't let yourself confuse with this disinformation.. In school they taught us that the type of communism proposed by Karl Marx was not installed into political systems and it was abused and corrupted e.g Soviet Union Yea all of the professor in the universities are communist put there on purpose with the liberal agenda Even Jordan Peterson reinforces this I think In some of his lectures He is pretty knowledgable in that subject Phil Also the food in Soviet Russia was bad , all the processed and tinned foods you could think of.. Only people living in the villages could eat like all the people ate before the communism.. Mandatory vaccinations , drugs and antibiotics.. Food shortages that would happen and someone would have to starve while others would eat.. And you could not be ready for food shortages because the state might take it and you could not hold food for bad day in general.. You was only allowed to have your garden.. If you would have animals they could be taken pretty fast away from you.. No self sufficiency.. So self governance.. Everything can be taken away from with a blink of an eye.. Your land, your food, your animals.. People would rat each other if they did not like them so they could take their possession.. Coming up with things they did not commit.. I agree to an extent, I might be saying that cuz my parents had a different experience But one thing for sure Vilt after when perostroika happened life was even worse for sure 🤣.. No one was paying their taxes until like 2002 Mafias grew stronger People would be rated for acts they did not commit and just killed.. Children would be left without Fathers, mothers..

They did that because Soviet Russia was a testing ground and they were developing there all kinds of new technologies that so called ""deep state"" use these days.. For example, already in the sixties they had a microwave weaponry in Soviet Russia, that can trigger heart attack from 200-300 meters and cause death indistinguishable by a medical from ""normal heart attack""..

That's because before the perestroika was socialism and after the perestroika there is socialism as well... Other foods like tomatoes could replant and season on their own without any work too.. The fruit would be smaller tho.. Other root plants and vegetables could do the same, you could use them as feed for your animals like pigs to fatten them up.. - Yea, ofc ""communism"" it's against human nature,- It's not a fairy tale,- It worded in a real life very well Where 0_0 The same thing is happening in American, German, Japan, Brazil universities etc, everywhere !.

You can only see extreme left leaning people in high concentration at universities, that shows that it is an agenda.. The professors are picked for a reason..

Unless you have to run away and leave your property.. But you can always take your gold with you Gold-silver is a trap.. Just read Silvio Gesel and Gottfried Feder against usury .... The ""we want to live"" book from economic matters.. this book literaly caused the II World War lol 😂 There are other covers that are more ""political incorrects"" for century XXI men Primal tribes must be free of interest-usury it's a must Imagine you found out what Aajonus did then Gestapo or kgb show up and kill you because it doesn't align with the government agenda or ideas.. Pretty retarded to think its good.. And what is even more retarded is to let the government decide what is bad or what is good.. A government that you can't criticise or say anything against.. ^^^☝️",29,455
4688,And bitcoin?. lol Communism in theory would actually work to be honest But In reality it’s abused,2,17
4689,"guys im the only one that im not seeing good changes on diet ?. Wrong word, that is not communism.. Use something else to describe it to not cause a misunderstanding.. I don't understand why people investing in gold first.. What they should do first is buy land and becoming self sufficient as best as you can, you cant eat gold.. Centralized communism is just an excuse for elites to dominate the people.. True communism where people live in loosely-coupled communes minding their own affairs is good I prefer to invest in gold.. I have not enough knowledge about cryptocurrency, too speculative.. But as far as I know bitcoin has become very popular in Venezuela.. Looks that in a country plagued by hyperinflation which renders the local currency close to worthless, bitcoin is the only way to buy anything now.. Hyperinflation is very likely to happen in Poland too.. Europe as well.. So cryptocurrency might be a good option to consider 🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂Communism would tell how to eat, what to buy, where to work, etc.Is the opposite of primal life in ger its 32% - still a green land Gold is a great investment if your basing a financial decision.. But for personal development, lifestyle, and investment wise.... You still can't go wrong with purchasing land in a desirable location.. it's nothing to do with any regime is simple an opinion against usury, central banking system, monopolies and fiat-money https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlXqFgqOviw&t=3s&pbjreload=101 Bitcoin is only good for speculating as it don't have any intrinsic value and cant be a store of value because you never know what its price gonna be.. It would not work, you need government to enforce it.. It hasn't worked in all of countries it was.. It destroyed them.. It was the elites way of controlling the population and taking their wealth nothing more.. I am sure there is a lot better system that we don't know yet that doesn't include kgb and censorship.. Yo guys , a friend (who is not on the diet) has a rash for over a year near his genitals , what do you recommend to apply topically ?. He says he has been eating more meat(cooked) and change his underwear to a different kind and it is better Sad world I am sure there is something he could do, just search rashes in the pdf.. He could mix mineral water with clay and apply it there, or clay with butter.. Or butter with honey.. Primal cream.. Good quality organic cotton clothing too.. You would have ti experiment a little.. nice - i need 3 1/2 - 4h to get there ;) also swiss has good forests/milk too 😁 I will 😎🧚‍♀ Pesticides, grass cutting, and tree cutting destroy wast amounts of ecosystems and insects that eat mosquitoes or keep them or their larvee at bay and that is why i think there are more mosquitoes then there should be.. Have you tried eating high meat as a repellant ?Right now where i am there is only a few mosquitoes while before that there were thousands of them.. when im eating highmeat for a longer time it wont have any higheffect you might be ""adapted"" / used to it .... Every now and then.. But i dont feel the high i would probably have nausea from the smell",33,554
4690,"nice ;) when im home i will crack one of my higheggs.do you still consume highmeat for a longer period of time?. when i went to the forest some years ago i was wondering about the strange sound - after some time i found a big pond where millions of mosquitos where gathering - the sound was insane, really.. it sounded like an army of killerhornets.. and the sky was almost black by the mosq.and yes there are proj.. like g m o -ticks / mosquitos n co.. No.. I never feel the high.. Bad taste.. Disgusting.. Nauseous 3 months old",10,101

And the water stays for a few or even more years.. When i would go to spent some time in the forest there would always be these flooded parts were trees have been cut.. The water would look like black tea.. there isnt one real forest in ger anymore - all cultivated forests.... but yes we still have some ""forests"" Lmaoooo ill do it if you bury some meat for me there and give me the coordinates ;) Oh wowie",11,139

That’s why I said in “theory” it would work..... Agree.. Just hight inflation eats away your savings, this is what we already have in Poland plus it’s easier to buy gold or silver rather than the land in the first place.. It’s just a temporary solution in order not to lose all money Can you answer me this ?. Was it a professor at university who told you or is it your parents..

London is more domesticated than ever I wish I had that in England I studied at that the university of Sussex in England and have a law degree.. I did have a conversation with a professor who taught history, and there are sources which demonstrate that the education system was indeed much stronger and better No i just want to know from whom you got the information from.. So i was right about the professor ?We can enable slavery too and live well, except the slaves and defend how healthy we are or how smart we are or how good our houses are built or how good our food is.. I have listened to people tell me how people at the top lived well, the others, lower class did not.. And how freedom was minimised, no choice.. Everything was predestined for you.. And the government was still all powerful.. That’s experience Younger kids were already taught most of the stuff that older teenagers in England are learning But I’m talking about the quality of education okay true I agree To let the government decide what to teach your kids and no freedom to choose is bad in it self I can find them if you want and link them to you They would know I’ve spoken to many parents who came from soviet era and they all said the same And how the whole curriculum system differs immensely ..... And how it compares to my education in England I also gave you an example of my parents experience in studying subjects at school and the speed of their progression The worst thing is no freedom no free choice.. Work was compulsory.. There is no point in defending something that bad while only nitpicking the few good things.. Vilt lol bro ask your grandparents and parents does working class count as lower class And not running around like sheeples i would rather kids learn how to milk a cow Nope, if your family lived good others had to work for them.. And there were a lot of them.. And there were food shortages.. Some had great life others not.. No point in defending it.. The whole premise that the government does it all for you weakens you.. Perestroika That’s after the collapse of communism Life was actually good for my family there, there was structure and unity There were food shortages in the first place, you had to eat what you could have KGB don’t give 2 bollocks about if you eat raw dairy or meat It’s a bit one sided bro In soviet Russia no one was told what to eat and how to eat Nope",19,456

Hiding the flaws and all facts that happened.. independent peoples all means of production controlled by the State communism as it has been practiced in recent history is no good It ain’t one sided lmao it’s facts The only country that I know who practice this system atm is Israel I think when they were 7-9 they already started algebra so the education system was very strong 💪 if you compare it to other system and the west Its a bit one sided bro i dont think they like homesteaders/farmers",6,141

But yeah honey is ultimately the best @vilts Caleb 6 Hmm about 80kg muscley was about 90kg but I lost 10 due to gyms closin down but I have my own goats so it’s easier because they don't eat any building materials Also I’m 17 so I can’t really go out and get a cow or fund the raw cows milk I can see it’s obvious sv3rige gained weight by his physique, he is more pumped Goats milk is high in hormones especially adrenaline, so someone who is thin and hyperactive should not be drinking goats milk but cows milk.. People who are overweight its fine for them they could use the extra hormones.If you feel hyperactive or anxious don't drink goats milk.. Goats cream wont relax your system cows will.You won't gain any weight if you are thin and drink goats milkThis was somewhere said in Q&A just drink the goats milk My bad Not cows milk Goats milk You need to drink cows milk you want to gain weight The point is not about mango, honey has fructose aswell, any fruit to complement the primal diet helps gain weight, I personally can’t build or add on muscle without carbs period I’ve noticed I’ve been quite hyperactive lately not been able to sleep that’s something I will think about although I meant as in I don’t have much money as to go buy a cow my family have a goat that we get milk from 6 feet deep  Good thing that you found it and call it bullshit instantly.. It keeps the information being right and sticking to what is best for us..

Don't know about the organic brand , but still i would not eat it unless i know what they feed them.. But you should be safe eating it raw anyway, cooking it would make it even worse organic salmon from norway is soy fed the soy is organic, that's why they call the fish organic, for the rest it's the same as non-organic farmed aslmon Wild salmon is a better choice No soy In the book, what to eat when you have cold or flu My butcher is pretty cool aswell i told him if I can buy a whole lamb but he would dry age it in his own facility just because I don’t have a spare fridge to hang the meat and he agreed so whenever I want to eat something from the lamb I can just pick it up on the day So anyone who wants to spend a bit less as primal can be expensive, try to build relationships with farmers and butchers, it’s really worth it also my friends dad works as a local butcher and he always gives me all the fat for free every time I buy meat from them Because the face gets super cold Pillow too..

Q: No i only had it with my juice.. A: You are going to have less with your juice.. Q: Is that for everybody ?. A: No, that is for her.. She has sore in her mouth that means her system is very acidic and that means she needs more of that alkalizing juice with that whey, also for you knee problem whey is good for removing mineral build ups in the joints as well as uric acid build up in the muscles that causes cramping.. Q: Could i drink whey too in smaller quantities when i make cheese ?. A: You can with 4 ounces of vegetable juice with 4 ounces of whey if you have acidic reaction then 8 ounces with 4 ounces of whey, if you get acidic reaction then 8 ounces with 2 ounces of whey..

4738,"In the video, it says ""setting on low"".. Does it mean low heat?. Another one.. Where do you all keep coming from What happened with bone broths is that the minerals are cautherised from the heat and they collect under the skin and joints unused, as a poison.. And what happens from that is your skin get thicker and thicker.. You could also get joint problems.. Your skin would be thick like Silvester Stalone, because he has been on bone broth diet.. This was what AV said in one of his Q&A With vineger Derek does this method to eat bones @davidnavas1212 I agree with small fish easier to eat the bones.. At this moment I have the salmon This one is wild caught.. So, I feel safe eating the whole fish LOL SILVESTER STALOE Set for 3-4 days Avocado w meat would cause digestion issues?.

To poison the fish more so it would be too toxic for parasites and bacteria to develop.. As they would start to detoxify the fish.. And they don't want that.. They also probably add antibiotics and of course the pharmaceutical earns a lot of profit from it so profit is the first biggest motivator.. You can't have healthy fish when you farm them.. I hope the seller didn't lie because the fish tastes pretty good Why the hell they vaccinate fish The seller says from Norway Read about genetically modified salmon it was done on 1989..

I don't think that is hard.. Just eat something else.. I always in the morning drink some fermented milk with honey and some eggs.. Sometimes meat, that wakes me up really well.. Sometimes my raw milk left fermented turns to yogurt but i don't like it.. I only drink milk that is clabbered or fresh still warm one.Some people are sensitive some are not, depends on the toxicity of their body so some might feel something some might not.. Our bodies can take a lot of beating.. oh I think you misunderstand, i do well on it No , just online he has been very helpful, no disagreement there i just shared my experience earlier that's all see, i disagree with that.. i don't think it's junk food.. commercial yogurts are junk food Gotta separate what the brain wants and what the body wants yeah and i recognize that it isn't good because it's heated.. it may not heal me.. but i doubt it is harming me especially since i don't eat it all the time.. but again, it's not pasteurized though which is key.. I guess I could go without salt too, for like a week at first i'm good without salt.. i stopped that easily, which was surprising to me coffee gives me diarrhea now and makes me feel sick i used to drink 1-2 cups of strong coffee Vaccinated, soy fed loads Where you live too ?.

He already knew about leaky gut some time ago, that is how people would get problems with their joints because undigested food would go there to get digested.. Nothing to worry when you are on primal.. Dysfunctional gut floras sounds like doctors coming up with excuses to feed you more antibiotics.. Or Ray peat shills shilling flushes..

Right now i don't eat any because i don't have that much hard cheese and if i would eat cottage cheese i would have to make it, but i drink all of the  milk most times so none left to make it.. I would eat cheese when i crave it because i don't have that much to eat every day.. And i keep some for a pain.. You can eat it before a meal too.. But it is best to eat it in the morning without honey so it would act as a sponge.. And only later if you want it with honey for minerals or eat it without.. Too much cheese can cause constipation so eat it with little bit of butter.. It is not that hard to make hard cheese.. Whenever i would have enough milk for cottage cheese i would just turn it to hard cheese.. You take cottage cheese, put it in a mold, press it for some time.. Take it out, wrap it in waxed paper or put it in cloth and then let it age in the fridge..

At least you know that it is bad.. Some people listen to it and think it is true.. I see all the young girls falling for that Milk, liquids in general, i think explained it somewhere.. When you drink cold milk it pases to the blood undigested.. I have never heard AV talk about eating cold butter so i am sure it is fine.. All i can say that cold foods digest slower in general.. He would say liquid foods like milk pases to the blood undigested because it is liquid but solid foods won't.. Yogurt in general is bad because they heat it too high..

4808,"No theories?. He is pro vaccine And seen as a saint And he loves fertilers I read somewhere man only cooked meat because when he found no animals he needed to soften tube vegetables or any random rodents insects etc he found around With American indians.. They would follow the herds and eat raw.. When they settled in the canyon after some time living there all the animals were hunted out.. So they started to cook vegetation and other plants to make them edible and then started cooking meat with it to make it more tasteful.. And other tribes still eat it raw.. There is also an old chinese dish that they make on special events like we have Christmas here.. That is made of raw pork.. Mongolians would eat raw Cooking meat goes hand in hand with coking grains and other vegetables to make them eatable In the Arab word we have a dish called kibbye nayyeh and it’s basically minced lamb with some herbs and it’s a delicacy.. For some reason other dishes have to be cooked because of salmonella 😆 no common sense whatsoever Propaganda And they’ve been eating that dish raw for decades now!. hmm sometimes im thinking to go carnivore, yesterday i was able to eat only 1 meal + was not possible to sleep, today all my stomach making noise when i just keep hand there i can feel a lot of flatuence they sometimes keep coming throught my mouth idk why.. maybe very ill / toxic ppls cant use them properly or its a too heavy detox or the stuff goes in your bloodstream or whatever.. your system is damaged - you should introduce new things slowly.. try n error...",14,287

I’ll try to find what he said, he linked a study too everything comes w a risk Stores have to tell you where the eggs come from and even have to list what the animals are fed with!maybe you can see the farmer on the package.... and find out his phonenumber.. If you just consume the eggyolk and you have probs with it its fed with soyashiet.. do you just eat the eggyolk or even the eggwhite?most of very sick ppl have probs with eggwhite in the beginning - also with milkstuff.. I eat the entire egg But I can buy local eggs just call the farmer and ask what they are fed with.. Yup",10,207

But inside his right ear he says it still feels sore.. He also had an operation to remove cholesteotoma back when he was 12 years old.. But now he’s 23 and it might of came back but he doesn’t know for certain because he is still waiting to get an MRI scan..

4812,"Why they went deaf ?. Is this the doctor speaking ?. Many patients who are assessed and operated have that particular decease in different stages, for example my friend was lucky that it did not reach to the stage where it leached into the skull compared to another patient who left it untreated and went completely deaf",3,57

Assistant brought the papers to that lady calling herself doctor and she said I was tested positive for two types of parasites.. So then I asked to have a look at those papers.. Well,  results were negative.. So I am like WTF))) And she said quote “even though it was not confirmed by lab tests doesn’t mean you don’t have them”))) And I like what if I started treatments because of your diagnosis.. She was so stupid that any discussion was useless.. But I took it all very lightly.. I had so much fun on the show)) There was this vegan lady)) And I was wearing green shoes..

Therefore, i completely understand why some people don’t want to associate with him.. However, to discredit him completely would not be sensible because he is the source and key 🔑 to Ajjanus vonderplanitz, his platform has grown bigger which is good because that means more people can find AV and learn about the primal diet.. He is an example as he demonstrates his own experience which could convince more people to try the primal diet.. He has a few videos that have a million views which is good because it’s raising awareness, and the fact that he does mini protests at vegan event shows,  could bring more attention to the primal diet..

I also disagree with her meat stock soup protocol so I removed that because I felt like shit from that and had reactions to it.. I did this ages ago around 2 years ago, I basically excluded  all carbs except for a bit of honey to control cravings, because I realised starch was irritating my gut.. Back then I couldn’t handle raw butter, milk, cream,  so I slowly started with lots of raw sour cream and raw yoghurt, as there’s barely any sugar in it, and then handled it quite well and reintroduced all forms of raw dairy and had no issues.. This worked for me in my experience.after a month I was able to tolerate white rice with raw butter and different types of fruits and had no issues i used gaps diet too 1 month ago but i couldnt handle red meat in stock my digestion was terrible, i can handle all dairy, only that im having everyday stomach pain/burning and oranges seems sometimes to help a bit, lub formula doesnt help me Yes many women lost their periods trying to be zero carb..

I wonder what ajonus would say abouy ibogaine sick.. i just made a real nice nut butter and my wife actually ate it and liked it.... she has an aversion to all primal foods (dairy, meat) fear of germs, you know the scoop maybe this will scoop up her excess hormones so she can eat more primal too.. great day in my life june 12 2020 right on pal.. well microdosing is pretty good concept, and ibogaine immensely effective",8,137

It takes a fat bullet from a rifle shotgun to take down this motherfu%ker.. They are also so smart, if you manage to escape from it by climbing a tree and think you’re safe, lol that boar is going dig down deep into the ground to rip off the roots of the tree to make it fall and wild boars usually bite the butt cheeks I dunno why maybe cuz it’s soft and fatty Pure alpha He looks so russian im having everyday stomach pain/burning , meat is from butcher ..

So a lot of these things were made to give something to the slaves to do.. ""Medicine"" The rulers of the slaves did not waist their time on these Makes sense Fat is seen as healing, water only sips.. Raw milk healthy.. Many things similar imo Many fat people in India.Yes they agree water only sips or for certain treatments I buy it at natural stores.If I don't have I try use another thing: cream, butter, etc I will make my own coconut cream..

4917,"?. I'm on 100% raw primal AV style diet only for about 2 years now, but before i was over 5 years on carni spin-off, so called ""optimal diet"" by Jan Kwasniewski (it's basically AV diet but not raw, also it's very high on fat) i noticed interesting things: After about 2-3 years i started to dislike cooked fat and got cravings for cooked carbs, but i didn't have any raw veggie cravings.. After getting on AV diet i still eat like 1 cooked popato a day, but i started strong raw veggie cravings after that 6 months.I don't like nuts that much, so i didn't eat nut formula alot, however i'm planning to replace potato with nut formula for like 6 months and see if by myself.It's some kind of starch craving.. There could be two things: My ancestors were starch slaves and i need to clean extra hormones with a bit of starch like AV said or second: it could be thing Jan Kwasniewski talked about -> when you eat alot of fat (i eat nearly a pound per day) you need a little bit of carbs (best is starch) as a ""fire starter"" he called it.. I experimented this many times on myself and when i eat lard without potato, i feel heavy got nausea and no energy and when i add just a little bit (like a teaspoon amount) of cooked potato to the same amount of lard, it works like a charm and i got tons of energy, i'm in great mood and don't feel any hunger for half a day.O.k.. For all those who eat fat, i just found (in the book ""Early Training with Aajonus"", page 23) that AV is expressis verbis talking about the same thing JK said: ""The sugars burn the fats.. Twenty percent of the energy to burn eighty percent of the energy.. So, it’s like the firecap in a bullet.. That’s what sugar is.. It helps ignite the fat"".. natural medicine?. No!. ppl back in the days used a lot of plants - cuz they knew how to use it as a medicine.. Like anything these days Chill down I agree I think there is a lot to learn from ayurveda, TCM etc In response to wood is good I said they are the same with certain materials beung bad when cooking I didnt say it was the best Thats all I said It is Commercialized yes Phil When i started out primal diet.. After 4 months i really needed starches for my hormones.. But i have watched sv3rige say nuts are toxic and had lots of problems because of that and i did not make a nut formula.. It was a mistake.. Now i need it less and less, but it depends on what kind of meat i eat.. I agree that at the start starches do more good then bad.. But later on if you don't need them they don't do anything good especially cooked.. I think I need tons of starch I have to eat from time to time some starch myself.. But i am hopping that after a few years i won't have to.. Atheltes need starches like rice.. Milk puts on too much weight and in large quantities is hard to digest for most You ever found those athletes who were on primal diet ?. AV was talking about them.. Myself for one, and Tyler druery on YouTube These ones are new.. But older ones.. In his Q&A or somewhere he was talking about them Ebrahim has mentioned some guy too Yea i guess.. Not digesting would probably mean that it won't work either.. But i was saying in the context that we should try nut formula first with raw nuts and only then go cooked starch if it doesn't help.. Raw is always better to our health then cooked",31,646

If you read properly I did mean that it’s okay to eat it “occasionally” and also here’s a piece of text from Ajjanus himself Lemme zoom in even more for clarity Everyone is different Not only nut formula but also “cooked starches” It makes no sense to mr First fat binds to toxins  and now starch,5,88

4922,how to detox AGEs?. If eaten “too much” of cooked starch not a little And nut formula is a lot better then cooked starch.. You should only eat cooked starch when nut formula doesn't help hard to obtain truly raw nuts And in that text he clearly says eat cooked starch if you can’t digest raw starch i think one small or medium potato with 3-4 tablespoons of unsalted raw butter works well Sunflower or pumpkins seeds should be easy You can grow sunflower yourself You basically proved what I was saying mate 😂😂 If you really want to put a strain on your health there are certain things you can eat.. Like red meat to excite the adrenals and drink goats milk.. You will get even better results.. But your health might suffer.. Caleb throw in  some raw butter Only light walking Probably I think caleb will be ok with tvose extra carbs to perform That’s fine not that bad If you compare it to bodybuilders they eat 100x more 100g l Guys I am loosing control over my nose muscles And over all facial ones True i have shooting painin my shoulder going down my arm Lol Why r u laughing m8,7,204

You add butter and eggs.. To bind with those bad things av said somewhere that soaking actually increases anti nutrients No you would develop diseases from that in the long term.. Cooking things will always make you have a disease Yea.. Soaking is bad.. Sprouting things too Ajjanus said that there are some that have enzyme mutations and are able to be healthy whilst eating some cooked foods compared to those who don’t as they are able to digest it.. Ajonus cang cure MS/ALS Starch should only be eating with lots of fat Made my final interview btw.. For a series on psych med damage If you put that in perspective every single type of disease stems from the gut flora, if you mess it up, then obviously you may develop disease People nowadays eat their cooked foods without barely eating raw fat.. They take anti biotics, medications etc and so they are vulnerable, I doubt that if a primal person who eats 95% raw and occasionally has some cooked foods like white rice is going to have some sort of exaggerated disease in the long term  unless their gut flora is damaged Sure Not from the gut flora.. From toxins.. You change molecular structure of food when you cook it, you make free radicals.. You are trying to make excuses.. If you need starch make yourself a nut formula.. If that doesn't help then little bit of cooked starch.. That is how diseases from cooking develops.. For some it is a long term effects.. Or slow one.. But true years it adds up.",20,323

All the seafood and fish is wild and fresh from the sea.. They should have it in Sweden.. The point is it’s a big difference in price as it’s cheaper Changed perception Some foods are superior For his case it would be the best..

They are seasonal and it's hard to store them for the whole year.. Potatoes are easier to store, you can do it e.g.. like this (6:56) and they will withstand winter time.2.. I don't like to eat meat & fat with fruits, most of them cause bloating.. I like only tomatoes and plums.I'll test nut formula in the fall to see if it works for me..

It was well known in the past of what kind of effect those chemicals have.. And these leaks were happening back then, it has been building up since.. More and more..

And you can't really peel them I don't know why you keep posting sv3rige, he has no idea what he is talking about.. People get problems from drinking raw milk or eating raw butter it is because they are detoxing the pasteurised dairy or the minerals or fats with it are binding with toxins or the quality is not good.. Some people really cant tolerate dairy I’m going to have to disagree with on this one only because I speak from my own experience.. If I just heard sv3rige say that I wouldn’t just blindly follow and post.. There was a time where I stopped eating raw butter and raw milk because I had a leaky gut and other issues with my gut.. I healed it first eating only animals meat and animal fats like bone marrow and beef fat trimmings and pig fat (salo) for a month without any type of plant food for 1-2 month and I really felt my gut healed.. So I slowly introduced raw diary into my diet but was scared because I was scared of it irritating my gut and giving me problems.. But I slowly introduced it e.g I drank 1 teaspoon of milk a day , once I was able to tolerate milk I slowly added raw butter and other diary foods until I was able to fully tolerate it and I am happily able to eat all types of raw dairy without any issues.. I eat a whole jar of cream per day, almost a stick of butter a day and few tablespoons of raw yoghurt a day and still no issues so everyone is different vilt.. It really depends on the state of the gut.. You may disagree but it’s your opinion in the end Hmm I think my gut is like that Pig fat Will look for it +1 It is just raw dairy binding with the pasteurised dairy or minerals.. That is all there is.. If only sv3rige would listen to more of Aajonus Q&A.. If you do it slowly that is fine too.. Maybe it is even better.. You would not get these unwanted symptoms.. It is still not an allergy.. Aajonus actually say that if you get unwanted symptoms when drinking raw dairy lower the consumption.. And after some time you these symptoms would disappear Exactly Sweden Bet.. Back when I thought ice packs healed this one time I held it on my skin til it turned black and peeled off days later haha Warm heal cold mask You should still introduce the dairy slowly..

If it’s not relatable,  then i don’t 100% agree with as I’d lack experience.. Very simple and straight forward to understand.. And they eco experience Sv3rige echoes ajonus and natasha campbell It is like for some weird reason you look at him for reliable information.. Knew co producer.. He was vegan and looked like McGregor Worked in the industry Steroids I got instantly brainwashdd Because I discovered him when too late Sv3rige seems to be indecisive in whether vegetable juices are toxic or not, on the one hand, he presumed that maybe ajjanus was trying to make some money for himself which is understandable so ajanus promoted juicing.. But then sv3rige says that ajanus might have believed in juicing.. And the fact that in my own experience on how I found juicing to really benefit me by feeling cleansed and better able to digest a meat meal later through the day and so it makes me question sv3riges view on juicing as he also used to do it but I think sv3rige just doesn’t bother because he found blood and also he probs doesn’t have the money like he used to before I was referring to the ibogaine Say that to parkinson patients regaining smell and taste For recovery of dopamine neurons..

He is already misleading people.. But i am sure smart people will go to Aajonus for information.. Sv3rige is the gatekeeper and key to ajjanus vonderplanitz Just try to introduce raw dairy slowly and raw unsalted cheese.. They would do you good.. Cream too..

Coz lamb fat from no hormones no antibiotics animals gives me dry mouth and makes me very thirsty but I am fine with beef fat and stay satiated longer from the butcher which I don't know the source..

5066,Do you think I should buy?,1,6
5067,@mcknight2 where are you from?. When you get dry mouth it means that your body requires fat.. As it sucks every fat from your face and you get dry mouth.. It is written in the book It is restorable easily At first my face was lacking fat and i would get dry mouth so just eat butter and it will disappear.. Now i don't get dry mouth You could plant certain trees to cover some pesticide spraying.. But you should plan if you are going to buy land on keeping animals there.. Certain land is not suitable for farming and you can get it cheap for grazing.. Farm land is kinda expensive.,8,112

The cooked meat would get stuck in my teeth, i would get gum bleeds and other problems.. I find cooked foods nauseating when i think about them.. Good for me, it makes me stick on 100% primal.. There is no point in eating that way anyway.. Some are more fortune with health then others.. This started from eggs.. Laying in bed half side of face is tingling numb (more  than usual) I have fever for first time since meds I had MS flare up Found where he recommends to mix cream.. I think eggs should be fine too..

5076,"why does it go green and muscle meat does not?. Coconut cream has a lot of healing properties.. What do you mean risky ?. It is a health giving food.. What do you mean ?. You could call a lot of foods ""detoxing"" You would eat raw unsalted cheese for that.. And if a detoxification would be too harsh there is a way on stopping it.. But i think the body will decide if it is ready.. Coconut cream is used in so many remedies The same way people get problems with milk.. It is minerals and fats binding with toxins.. If you could even find real raw olive oil it is detoxing.. Aajonus was talking on eating coconut cream with fruit to detox Just get non frozen.. Aajonus would rather go for supermarket fresh beef then frozen organic Home from hospital One day earlier No, the cheese is just binding with toxins.. Unless it is salted or heated.. Leaky gut is not caused by parasite.. I had 2 lube formulas on the night it started End glycation byproduct I doubt only women No one would turn down honey or watermelon",16,191

They only grow in spruce Forrest Watch out for wild boars lol No difference , have the egg yolk with the juice Ajanus said himself to add egg yolk or cream to  vegetable juice You have to keep separate from meat and other products You remember where ?. Cream is hard to digest on itself Eggs triggered this I think WHAAT ?. Egg yolk is by far the best tasting raw animal food.. Maybe only raw liver is close to it.. the borgias pope was poisoned after he drank red wine with the poison inside.. He was dying, and his daughter saved his life with black charcoal as an emergency remedy.. I don’t know maybe the type of charcoal was different back then as this was a few hundreds of years ago but apparently it can be useful against poison Try mixing cheese with raw honey In sweden we have plenty Yes This is related to me eating high meat or eggs There are remedies for headaches.. You should try them I also read ajonus advice regarding you need mineral water for ms If eggs is something I react to, like many ms people, it would be very stupid to eat 40 eggs I drank half a cup coconut cream.. It made me really sleepy so i will go take a nap.. I think it is pretty detoxing.. It was the best thing i have ever tasted, all foamy and creamy.. I recommend others to try it too.. All i needed was a coconut and a juicer.. Will do",21,321

I know raw it's no problem.. I remember aajonus saying frozen fish isn't as bad as frozen meat Nope, only from high meat i get high Our bodies still need fruits, but only 5%.. For some it might be good to not eat fruit at all.. Raw milk and honey don't cause these problems.. Only fruits so eat them with lots of fat and you will be fine Yes.. Most of the people don't have allergies to milk, if they would the first sign would be cramps.. Intolerances they experience are actually detoxes, the dairy is binding with toxins in the gut causing unpleasant reactions or feelings.. You still need to eat dairy, smaller amounts and later on you will be able to tolerate it again.. Even if you would have allergies which is really rare you still would need to drink the milk.. To reprogramme the cells, it might take even to 6 months.. But it is curable While having Candida",16,273

You can make coconut cream without any tools.. And primitive people would do that.. It is easy.. They don't eat the fibre..

And it says to you where Aajonus talks about that particular topic, the time and the audio recording name.. The information there will always be more reliable and real then any other Primal diet chat, and answers should be searched there.. It should always be like that.. Especially for topics like candida.. 4-5oz in the book aajonus said that vege juice can alkalize the blood without alkalizing the (optimum) acidic digestive environment.. but then he says to wait 60 minutes after drinking veg juice before eating anything that requires acidic digestion it seems like it has contributed to my indigestion feeling right now 😭",10,137

Good quality fruits are awesome Lets talk in private I heard bigger fish like tuna and other types have the most mercury so go for smaller fish like sardines and other types Well if you eat raw the mercury will be bound in the fat so no problem, but I'm wondering if freezing it makes it still ok.. In particular I'm thinking of herring",3,67
5098,6 does that apply to frozen as well?. aajonus said frozen fish isn't as bad as meat Hmmm Sup people,2,20
5099,This is N audio?. i wasn't skinny before i started eating it either Gangrene bacteria it seems to be very usefu,2,21
5100,What exactly is gangrene?. 0 blood-lymph circulation on a tissue ?. This guy cranks it and you dont have to crank it the entire time.. just crank it 3 rotations once every 2-3 minutes for up to 15-20 minutes hmm i'm trying to look back to confirm but i don't see it on amazon any longer.. i think it was around $100 USD,5,63
5101,"And how long do you need to crank it ?. so i think if someone is skinny, they will get even more dramatic results l I would blend 2 eggs, 4-8 oz of cream, 6-8 oz of full fat raw milk, 1-2 tablespoons of honey you need to mix it with papaya oh i also mixed in berries, papaya, etc",2,60
5102,How much did it cost ?. I have the Donvier ice cream maker as recommended by AV.,2,17
5103,And what kind of ice cream machine you use ?. Can you so it with the cheap one ?,2,19
5104,"What are the ingredients you make it with?. it's been a while since I had it.. i saw people in the group talking about how to gain fat/weight.. I recommend raw ice cream, 2-3 cups every day.. That helped me a lot to gain weight.. Tomorrow night will be raw ice cream night",6,53

He has his vagus nerve cut off I remember finding that in the book I just can’t remember where Cutting Vagus nerve doesn't make you sterile.. Some links do some doesn't They are fat.. Just that hardened plant oil fat needs lots of water.. And it is really expanded.. They also still do encase toxins.. And protect from outside pollution Fat people who go on the diet recover better then thin people because there is no damage done to the tissue.. It is fat.. If they would not have it they wouldn't be obese.. It is just that fat expanded and holds water.. It still protects them.. Rotten meat triggered an MS attack Yea, you could have more fat molecules then obese people and look thin.. But they still do have fat it is just expanded like 10x.",13,152
5109,"Anti-AV?. Yes need oysters in my life!!!. Great thanks!. We also have a lot of raw cheese salted tho.. And fruit!. To me its weird we gets them Seafood, oysters, caviar works too Hi Juli, minerals are salt, you get it from eyes, vegetable juice, cheese, tomatoes.. You won't get sufficient amounts with meat and dairy",7,56

Most of the answers to a particular ailments can be found in the book or in the emails or in the Q&As.He wrote the books when he already had more then 25 years of experience.. He done that on purpose.. To not write stupid things.. Only rarely people ever do that.. You did had them.. You said it would be worse and worse for you even before the diet I never had these issues/attsck before the diet And you think that all it takes ?. The butter is not even good quality the same goes for eggs Plenty I ate butter and eggs And you didn't eat any dairy.. Which is really important.. Cream coats the nerves and protect them from these kinds of things High meat triggered an attack.. I shouldnt have taken it That is nothing.. You have to eat more.. And a lot of fish.. You don't have dairy.. You eat too little.. You stopped the juices because it was too expensive( you only did a few times) And the same was for fish.. You didn't have any cheese.. You don't eat eggs.You don't follow the diet plan.. Your not on the diet.. So don't say that diet triggered it.. At the start you already were saying that the fish is doing something.. The high meat might triggered the detox but it would have been countered by the cheese.. Take it easy ladies You are 19 and very arrogant.. 😂 Not the same thing He can't read Suet is too dry I’d go for softer fat You stopped the juices.. You said it was expensive for you.. You only did it for few days Cheese.. You don't have cheese It was the high meat Yes Fresh raw meat Lube formula, raw meat, green juices Multible schlerosis Because ajjanus said somewhere that in his surgery when he was like 20 https://youtu.be/hIKc4mRMkzk You did not do the diet, don't keep saying that That is not the primal diet.. haku read it everyday, if you have experience from university, use it because it’s effective, there’s  so many techniques to study a subject.. Study his book like you would for physics and maths lol, plan it out, and make notes, and use techniques to help you remember, once you consolidate all the info it will be so easy Well he said it because some students have read it 16 times and always found something new.. It is the same thing for me.. He was talking about getting some people trained himself and they would have to know his books and all his newsletter like their own fingers",34,492
5112,"I don’t know why he would recommend that, but imagine doing an exam, you’re obviously not going to pass it reading it once a year?. This for example Aajonus actually recommend to read his books once a year because of how much concentrated information is there You can find a lot of answers yourself.. In the topics pdf, in the books, audio recordings, emails.. The information there will always be the highest quality.. Some people can start giving advice without having any understanding what so ever.. Just ask the question whom it might concerns you, i can answer who i know from listening to the audio recordings myself and i went true a lot of them Aajonus level no.. Just people here who have listened to lots of his Q&As and read his books many times.. One date per day is good just eat it with lots of fat and make sure they are not steamed and sun dried.. Ditch the raisins.. Honey is good",10,165
5113,I also asked to a raw honey company for analysis of their 7 products but I dunno what I should look for on these analysis to understand which one is better quality ?,1,33

5115,"You guys know Mike Ma?. I said high meat triggered ms attack I tried to help you.. You did not get all the foods i told you.. The juices and fish were too expensive for you.. The butter was heated or not great as you find out in this group the same was for eggs, i asked you to ask what they feed them and they fed them soy which is a no.. What are you even saying.. YOU did not even manage to follow what i said for one week.. And you were already missing critical foods.. I only tried to find the best option for you The attack was detox from your nerves I got all thr foods you told me to No wonder it got worse for you Raw meat, juiced, eggs and butter How do you know this ?. Your not even read the books And you are probably force feeding yourself ?. I am planing to do so to gain weight also My bad I confused the 2 Really calming.. With butter i don't feel anything.. Moisturised Less thirsty No it wouldn’t it could last long If anything it will turn sour which is easier to eat for those with gut problems It becomes sour cream.. It is better then cream because it is predigested.. If you keep it longer a fungus develops but you still can eat it.. It doesn't become too sour You’ll see when you try it You’ll get addicted to it haku In my opinion I think cream and sour cream is the best creation of dairy, I can eat it all day and won’t get sick of it.. I find it more tasty and more appealing and it complements the fruits very well.. It’s basically desert.. If you have some kind of craving for shit food, or a sweet craving, raw cream with honey and berries do the trick I am craving brain at the moment, I haven’t had it in a while And Russian wild salmon caviar Salmon caviar has a similar profile to brain, they are both ideal Ajjanus said melons are good and useful to detox tars and damage caused by smoking addiction I think you can use something to replace it on your teeth but it’s more expensive I heard whereas mercury is free Apparently i found the number one seat Good stuff",19,397

You can feel it but i dont know how he could find out about the appendix being a library And cheese is just fermented milk with whey removed Different thing.. Butter is easier to digest.. I don't know the whole biochemical thing.. ya, but ALUMINUM!!!. i've eaten 1 or 2 moldy berries.. but not the juice",8,100

5119,But it was life things not detox ?. only when the tears are full of mold,2,16
5120,Psychical stuff you mean pain ?. Yea.. Aajonus said for some people starting out to not even consume milk as it would detox them too harsh.. Mostly cream or 50/50 cream milk.. Because they have a lot of toxic bile im lucky i can consume a lot of milk without detox oysters one time gave me a detox.. i felt tooth pain as they were removing metals.. didnt last long though Remember that your children won't have to go true all of this if you feed them primal i'm selfish and will spend all my money on myself/my wife to have land/primal food Butter is not cream.. Cream coats the nerves butter not Our bodies start to use bile for binding with toxins so some people get that much bile.. Carrot juices help,9,133

They would not live without them.. Even tree seeds have fungi in them, trees have fungi in them.. The same it is for us.. I think it is the mineral A in the juice..

I never swallow the yolk intact because it gives me a gag reflex.. Force feeding yourself is good and the fastest way to heal and gaining weight and for some it might be the only way to gain it.. Aajonus did do it himself and recommend for others.Just not at the start of the diet but it depends, you have to know what foods is bad to eat for your case as to not cause harsh detox.. And what foods to not eat realy big amounts like fruit",6,123
5125,"Was Aajonus' girlfriend Asian?. On the books.. You search it on the books He had many girlfriends I heard his Vegas  nerve got cut off, which makes sense why he never had kids I don't think that nerve is related to having kids Why ?.

If you cut it the body won't produce hydrochloric acid you look like you looking on your cellphone Says who safety is an illusion I think I named the wrong thing, what’s it called?.

After tasting all his meat sauces I will find the top 3 best tasting ones but it really feels like a rollercoaster ride, I get a dopamine rush after changing the sauces each day and appreciate the taste.. so anyone who is new are PSYCHOLOGICALLY struggling to eat any type of raw meat, use ajjanus meat sauces to hide the thought because the taste is really like magic..

It’s in his book.. Lol I dunno where you found that, I recently watched his live video yesterday where he left his high meat jar in the fridge for 3 months in Germany only because he wasn’t living there at the time and then when he tried it he said it was disgusting, nothing like the high liver he had before and that it’s maybe not worth even having it so he implied that it’s going in the bin.. i believe some corn-shit with antibiotics and soy, but i really don't have any other rn Ive only improved over  The course of 2 years",6,166

And the amount you would eat is small I don't know what you are even talking about.. In how many people i have met in my life none of them were ""healthy"".. Everyone had some sort of problem, be that with their teeth, their skin, balding issues.. The older they were the easier it was to spot these things.. It seemed everyone was functioning on some coffee or teas.. Or processed sugars.. Emotional problems.. Especially health seemed worse in younger people.. Unless you have no idea what health actually is or how we are supposed to function and look.. Some people have more toxins then others Yea, i only used to function on coffee which is a neurotoxin.. You could eat cheese every 15min or even more to improve your health even faster..

I sweat like crazy.. you get my point well, i mean doesn't make it fast It makes you sweat.. You can make sauna 40C°.. I have this option and everyone's I know at least it's my experience with them But it’s still more natural than infrared sauna been there a lot since was a kid",7,115
5199,"What ?. That’s what I thought as Russian banya is nothing like the typical saunas out there 80C° no one takes saunas here that high 60° and it is still too hot So infrared saunas are like taking the antibiotics pills.. Old school saunas are not as damaging.. So if anyone is wanting to take sauna then at least go to the not infrared.. I went to saunas a lot when i was little.. Did not like them, they really hot.. Unless i would just use water on myself every time i would sit there so in this case you can forget about them.... sauna which below 80C° doesn't make you sweat and no one actually taking them that low heat On beach sand I think to do sand baths",8,130

I see, thanks for letting me know average temperature in Russian banya is 100-120C° Breathing yes.. But whenever i would go to the cold water i would feel super bad after..

I think the amount of brains you would eat they would never be too much.. It is mainly fat.. Raw butter is fine.. I remember Aajonus was even talking on mixing butter with cream for some reason.. You won’t get that much fat in cream that’s why he probs added the butter True 6 my main source of fat is pig fat.. Cream is like a supplement for me before bed and butter is just a hydration supplement for me aswell as extra fat Milk drinkers of the world, how does the raw cow milk taste from where you are from ?. I had the ability to taste more then a few cows milk and one tasted fine.. Others not.. Not great at all.. Had a weird taste, smell like of a barn..

5215,what strains of bacteria grow on high meat?. No clue I’m not sure that Aajonus mentioned any send it to a lab and share the results 🙂 Q&A I’d go for darker Same Enzymes and I think it alkanizes the body if it’s too acidic or other way around Celery has a minus carbohydrate.. That means to digest it.. It pulls sugars from the body.. And it is good for a few years so it pulls out all of the toxic sugars.. Also enzymes.. When you add other sweeter juices to celery it balances it out.. And in so the carbohydrates doesn't cause problems.. That is why the ratio is 80% 20%.,9,112

5264,"You do juices in the morning ?. Ancient semolina maybe Crazy man @oldblooded I was eating frozen butter one moment in time because i did not have anything else.. And if i did not have any options i would still eat it.. I just know that frozen is not ideal so i always look for fresh.. I was eating frozen sheep at the start of the diet i did not have anything else.. You just know what each food gives and how certain things effect it.. So you decide and calculate the best option you can have for your health that can work in your situation.. They keep you in hospital and feed you shit until you will get problems again.. You won't heal if you are in hospital.. You need to eat im 184cm and 62 kg or so One dish is made from eggs, cottage cheese and probably sugar, the second one i think is boiled corn with milk.. At least his family could bring him something.. Tomatoes Or urine fast I’d demand it from my family I understand man but this food is garbage I’d urine fast If i did not had food there i have a severe pain in my intestines, doubt that this is appendicitis, ultrasound and blood analysis haven't found it too.. looks more like colitis Or do this i am very skinny, better any food then nothing.. aajonus said that it's dangerous to have almost no fat left in body I know, that is why i am telling you to get out of there",14,261
5265,Ask your family?. but as i get home i will there is no raw foods in hospital Eat raw foods.. Remedies for appendix,3,23

See if it helps",3,79
5267,"Vilt , My terrible breath could be provoqued by eating too much fat?",1,13

Just leave it in room temp Takes a day or 2 2 veggie juicesRaw eggsRaw milkRaw beef with raw fat1 Lube formulaRaw cheese You would see a big difference in terms of digesting sour cream and cream You could ferment it Some people get inflammation issues after eating raw butter especially with leaky guts And with cream There’s sugar in cream Phil, you are genius.. its basically lubrication formula just tomato instead of lemon juice.. that is the first thing av gave monica which had peritonitis Vilt suggested pain formula aswell We make butter here not with raw cream but with sour raw cream here.. yeah, but i definitely won't have ingredients for this one unfortunately i am😂 when you have peritonitis pain is constant until its late stages and there are other symptoms, so you'd notice Can you only get duck eggs?. I think that should be fine",6,165
5272,"but how do you make raw butter?. you need fresh cream to do it, so you refrigerate milk?. Every food has its own healing properties.. Too much coconut cream might not be good as it is pretty detoxing, but one tablespoon per day is fine.. And coconut cream is good food.. You put the coconut meat in the slow juicer and coconut cream comes out.. You can also use the cream for toothpaste and other remedies - dishes You don't spit, you have to squish it in your mouth(the milk) and then spit it out in milk.. There is information on coconut cream in Q&As you could listen there.. Why?. Eggs are important in this diet, isn't it?I have a lot of noises in my stomach.. And very acidic stools and urine.. But I feel fine Just talking about the bad breath, seeing if they’re related I would prefer some chewing gum now and then chewing myrrh (natural) resin soup meat is very chewy raw meat, better than eyeball 👍🏻👍🏻",12,170
5273,"Should i drink raw high egg?. Bruh that looks disgusting 😂😂 Ikr Worms having their time of their life in that egg swimming pool hahaha Woohoo I personally used to have a leaky gut and an ulcer like 1-2 years ago, I already mentioned it in this group chat, and sour cream did like 80% of the healing I really started respecting it I ate chicken’s intestines with fecal matter After that you just drink milk and you’re good Yes.. When I remember.. It makes the breath worse",4,88

Or this one You can do it with fresh or with sour cream oh, sour cream is okay for butter?. fine  ty You put it in a blender, or use any other way.. There is a lot of ways to do it Yes, i would make it with sour cream.. But when you make it with fresh cream the taste is better in my experience.. thanks guys i will have helmeted guineafowl eggs, any one familiar?😂 How’s the quality",7,102
5276,Aajonus says this?. Yes I see,2,6

Pain formula removed it.. I had leg pain that i could not even walk with that leg, it felt like something had shot it.. But remedy for the leg pain removed it.. i definitely don't have acces to unsalted raw chees and bee polen When will you get home ?. You are not in great situation that you have let yourself be in hospital.. For teeth pain i would just make lubrication formula that did the job in 4-5 hours in best case",11,187

5284,"You get pains and other problems ?. yeah, i felt pain all night even though I was given painkiller",2,19
5285,How big was the pain ?. You are staying in hospital.. For you to get better or lose pain you have to eat raw foods and supply your body with nutrients so it can heal and remove those toxins causing you the problem i couldn't sleep and it was really hard @leofriskey You haven't tried pain formula Yea you are in hospital there is no raw foods there.. Food is the only thing that can help.,4,76

5287,"i understand, but would food heal if the liquids is already out of gut?",1,14
5288,"how could food help remove it?. because they treat it with surgery I see I’m not sure but logically cream is still good but when someone is having serious issues with their gut sour cream is easier to digest as the cream is predigested and the fermented bacteria does it’s magic to repair gut issues Like vilt said Drink it like every 4 hours Smetana is raw sour cream understand You have to make your own sour cream.. You just let cream stand and fermented, then it turns to raw sour cream Yes but depends on how many litres It should Cream will rise to the top",3,107
5289,"after it sours or fresh?. And you should just scoop it out but you won’t have that much for 1 litre so get like 5-6 litres and that will be enough to have like 3-4 tablespoons of it per day or if you are able to make so much of it eat like a jar a day if you can afford it Cream usually rises to the top when it gets refrigerated.. When you keep it at room temperature and milk ferments you get sour cream at the top and fermented milk at the bottom got it, ty i will try raw smetana is perfect in fact the best for stomach issues Gut problems Even Georgians from the mountains treasure it like gold where can i find any info on them?. heard many times",4,134
5290,"smetana is basically cream, right?. yeah, just have to get raw butter first in city - no",2,17

5293,"how long do you wait until its ""ok fermented""?. 1-2 days Hide it in your cupboard Or in a dark place and it will be faster or you can add a teaspoon of honey and the bacteria will feed of the honey and ferment the milk even faster oh, i have honey, will do with it.. ty Ask your dad to buy lots of it Exactly 🤮 god Lol that would be like a chocolate snack for him, piss easy to eat Yeah lol fine, ty Outside yes",3,88

You don't need to eat rocks, you can get sodium true other means.. And when are we comparing ruminants to humans ?. Salt is a really nasty thing.. To think that salt is necessary to life is really ignorant from this video producers.. We only started to use salt when we started to eat grains and cook foods I followed the diet on high quality foods Everything naturally it was very expensive especially here in the states and when I started eating grain fed and soy fed food man the food states awful..... still do primal but 70% I eat rice baked potatoes with ghee etcI cut the fruits 100% This is primal, we eat raw here.. Cooking is what degenerates, raw is what heals.. Primal diet is eating raw I tried them recipes but my body just don’t like grain fed beef and supermarket eggs So if they are not properly raised cooking those foods makes it even worse.. And besides, cakes taste good too, you should eat what is best for your body, not to follow taste I’m aware of all of this That’s why I’m focusing long term Instead of spending money and eat healthy for few months I’d rather save up a bit and move to a farm and live naturally 100% Well, is food is not palatable how you gonna eat it ?. I don’t eat for taste.. I don’t eat cakes or any processed foods.. I stopped being fully primal when the quarantine hit back late in March and I see the energy difference.. I totally feel it but it’s what it’s I still drink lubrication formula at the end of day everyday It helps with washing out everything lol You do what you can, that is fine.. We all should strive to do what is best for us.. Yes sir.. The white at the bottom is milk protein?. This is lubrication formula left in my car when it was 90’ outside Mustafa, you do what you can.. Just remember that when you cook foods most of the toxins gets dislodged from the fat protecting them and starts to cause damage.. Nothing really....I cook my liver sometimes with garlic and onions and spoonful of ghee Super delicious.. got it Salt will remove any healing properties it has, it will stop you healing, it is a poison and will slowly degenerate your system.. If you can find salted you can definitely find unsalted yes it works just as good i think so.. most of the cheese i buy says microbial rennet on it haku u are learning so much you are like the rainman of primal.. So what happens if I ate beef liver that was kept for 11 days in the fridge?. It’s covered This group has this intention.. To share each other knowledge..

5309,"in fridge, right?. Yes or in a dark cold place beneath the house where people put sacks of potatoes in Russia thank you Salted salo is not even that salty to be honest.. Animal fat will never absorb more than it needs Strips of raw animal fat from the meat It has salt, defiantly no Olive oil ain’t that bad, the real one tho not the one that is heated above AV temperature standard It has to be unheated, it just hard to find oil like that because most of the producers lie.. And plant oils are really detoxing.. Not something you should replace your fat with all its benefits like its chelation amino acids That honey could turn to free radical sugar and you would feel it pretty fast.. I once ate honey that was burned on one side, felt the difference really fast i read the recipe book and thats the most important bit for me.... plus milk baths on a regular basis, not much to comprehend just eat what the book says thank you Kingly My son had a wicked detox last week, fever and vomitting..

In another lecture he stated 80% Tomato chicken soup with pickled jalapeno i went in his house to get honey comb off him once, nice guy, loves talking about bees 21$ They put traps on beehives that collect beep pollen from bees and that is it, they just collect it.. because you're so classy hes an old guy, his daughter is taking over",6,312

When Aajonus was talking about milk he said only calming milk is cows, now i just don't know if it the camels milk work the same but i doubt it, i am sure Aajonus would have said it if it was..

Unless we are talking about cold ocean fish, some fish handle being frozen better, per Aajonus I pureéd it as well, was effortless to eat I know it is not optimal, and when you freeze things you lose a lot of things.. I am just saying that to tell on how low cooking actually is..

They are full of fear that they have corona, go to test and of course the test equipment is falsified.. But here that corona thing is just fake or a joke, hospitals are not full on how they say on the media.. People would go to check them and they would not be densely populated.. Same thing w mental health Psych meds kill people too so it’s like an all across the board healthcare thing Some people develop akathisia, bcs of liver enzymes, so that’s a pretty relevant cause.. Also the withdrawals They dont kill people, they turn them into robots I agree, but some people are more sensitive and depending on the med Wew, Aajonus was right and the corona won't do anything..

The same it is with bacteria when eating high meat, the body lets the bacteria pass that it needs.. You can look up parasites in the Q&A.. Everybody already have eggs of them..

Overspecialization fallacy by what mechanism do you think ""enjoyment"" is manifested in us?. dopamine and serotonin No.. You get healthier and you enjoy everything more and become more sensitive.. You also repair your cells by finally removing the toxins.This is like saying we should fast and not eat very often because of insulin which is theorical extrapolation.. that has nothing to do with what I just said.. you're comparing entirely different things.. ok prove me wrong You literally focus on 1 molecule and miss the forest for the trees First prove yourself.",14,166
5405,"how do you know?. agonist -> receptor -> effect Comparing taking cocaine to expelling toxin-filled waste.. OK that has nothing to do with it Lol jews are the biggest promoters of porn and masturbation I told you our happiness originates from somewhere in our body.. I say that is dopamine and serotonin.. if you think it comes from somewhere else then let me know.. because even gut bacteria, which is very important, ultimately affects these two things.. Aajonus was a Jew OK thanks for the lesson.. It's irrelevant though.. Dopamine or not will not get rid of toxins.. And your kidneys will not magically pull all the hundreds of quadrillions toxins from your body and excrete them provided they even get to them because I read the books and Q&A before going on forums and contradicting him we're not talking about toxins.. right now we talk about happiness if your dopamine receptors are used to spikes then you do need spikes to be ""happy"" ^ I read we want to live about a year ago.. I don't memorize every single thing in it.. ok sure.. take cocaine which is a dopamine agonist and you will feel happy.. you do understand what I just said right?. the less extreme dopamine spikes you have the more sensitive your receptors.. which means ultimately you enjoy even small dopamine ""rewards"".. like going for a walk in nature or what have you.. orgasm also reduces androgen receptor density in the brain it's a simple concept.. the less extreme spikes in dopamine you get the more sensitive your receptors become.. entirely possible.. but it still comes down to d/s.. see it's not even really about the nutrients.. the dopamine release from orgasm is so high it does affect your sensitivity.. ""energy"" is dependent upon multiple factors.. this is one of them.. yeah dude we already agreed on that",27,312
5406,"do you know how receptors and sensitivity work?. sure I do.. but it's depends on how high of a dopamine spike you get.. bro orgasm dopamine release is near equivalent to drugs as it should be.. makes total biological sense.. because unless I'm making a baby there's no use in it it affects my dopamine receptor sensitivity negatively read up on dopamine.. it's a well studied subject that high dopaminergic activities cause receptor insensitivity.. there are plenty of things that can give one pleasure.. orgasm has a detrimental psychological effect due to the biochemical activity.. bro don't abuse uncle ted appeal to nihilism fallacy Toxins will destroy your cells until you will not care whether your receptors are too ""sensitive"" or not.You only get big dopamine if you retain all the time.. that's unrelated to dopamine You only get much dopamine if you retain all the time.. because your body is desperate for it receptor sensitivity is what it is.. there's no arguing that.. Toxins giving prostate cancer are what they are.. There is no arguing that.. biochemistry says otherwise.. and my experience does too.. For how long have you retained and on primal diet I used to be a womanizer when I was younger, felt like shit You were not on primal diet.. I've done 3 years keto then 2 years raw carnivore now no because I'm more productive and happy when I don't orgasm every day You also don't detox",19,242

I think people can take it.. 🧯 Low-quality troll not at all I think there'd be more sense in sticking to the cooming argument instead ov da J00z for example the microbiota studies on depression recently have found that the way a good gut bacteria culture affects depression is exactly through that mechanism,5,75
5413,"who are you talking to?. He autist doe it's all about dopamine/serotonine everyone!!!. everything has a source.. you can try to ridicule my arguments all you want, AV too went in-depth on biochemistry in some of his talks.. Imagine not feeling like shit after cooming You cant be serious Do you have proof?. I need specific molecule.. There's indication that it puts your body in a state of shock.. Atleast whilst watching porn, which in conjunction provides a higher spike I have proof.. waiting for yours.. Ik that Maybe when you read the article to the end first..

5414,"Is that why people at gyms wipe their sweat with a towel?. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtsnVsgpkaU organic heavy metals usually accumulate in body fat also since your semen is cycled (reabsorbed by the body) that would then imply that whatever stored impurities would pass the endogenous excretory cycle again That's wishful thinking.. If you sweat and reabsorb your sweat you will reabsorb the sweat toxins again The point was semen retention.. the liver and kidney aren't wishful thinking.. unless you are still exposed to active toxins from your food/environment it will do another pass at excretion.. and if you are ingesting toxins from food/environment you should change that first Liver and kidneys aren't magical.. If you get bit by a venenous animal or snake you need an antidote, not doing nothing and wait for kidneys to save you How do u reabsorb sweat",7,140
5415,"which toxin found in semen cannot be excreted by the liver/kidney then?. There is more toxicity in your environment than you realize.. so reduce it.. get a HEPA air filter with a charcoal inlay.. EMF protection, etc.. It's already in your body.",6,42
5416,"which molecule?. Dozens of thousands.. You will find that out experimentally.. 🙂 stored toxins are only stored in permanent tissue.. such as fat.. but you can ingest less calories and lose that fat which then excretes the heavy metals.. semen being cyclical does that automatically after a while.. orgasm or not.. If you are not 300kg you have toxins in all your tissues including bones.. I need something specific.. otherwise it's just guessing.. not really, even brown adipose tissue can store heavy metals.. they are chemically attracted to it.. Aajonus did experiments.. You can perform all the tests yourself.",15,99
5417,maybe.. how much is that test you did?. It takes 50 to 200 molecules of fat or calcium-phosphorus-magnesium-potassium to bind to a single mercury atom for example.. We have hundreds of quadrillions of toxins.. 100€ only.. but it yielded so many results because I took the moldy berries which made the metals come out from my brain.. Before I had 0 detox and the tests would have come out with minimal levels (but still not 0 probably) I do ingest mostly fat.. I'm pretty much ketogenic according to my macros.. also getting enough calcium from dairy.. not really an issue for me.. not sure what detox you're talking about specifically.. I'm currently making my first high meat.. so if what you're saying is related to that I guess I'll see soon.,13,131
5418,"what about chelation, if you're worried about heavy metals?. Do a hair test and you will see if you have any levels of toxic metals in them Moldy berries chelate way more than dairy that my brain doesn't have a heavy metal pollution since I was never vaccinated true, as I said a high dose of even organic heavy metals can overtax your excretory organs.. Then you don't need primal diet.. who says I need it?. I eat raw carnivore because it makes me feel and look great and because most carbs are bad for the body We must all be as healthy as natives who live in pristine forest thanks to our kidneys who filter quadrillions of molecules of mercury I challenge you to eat moldy blackberries and then do a hair test.",5,134
5419,why would I do that?. to detox your metals I don't eat moldy berries to begin with,2,17
5420,"What did you feel like after eating them?. Unless I eat starch like white rice my erections don't go 100 percent Pulling in the head, itchy scalp, brain fog",2,29
5421,"because I research things?. damn, how long does it last",2,10
5422,"and you don't even know of the high concentrations of heavy metals present in our brains?. heavy metal concentration in the brain is largely from vaccines the blood brain barrier keeps most dietary heavy metal pollution out of the head I eat oysters everyday they’re better If you don't have enough fat it will store where fat can be found, bone marrow and brain With no side effects like av said with 1 moldy berry a day you will detox more metals and not lose all your hair too fast no @leclayrom you're wrong.. only modified heavy metals make it into the brain such as thiomersal which is ethylated.. non-ethylated or methylated mercury does not pass the blood brain barrier.. You have stored salt and sugar waste products in your brain too.. that's why vaccines should be avoided and why eating fish doesn't automatically make that mercury appear in your brain It remains somewhere in the body anyway.. Many metals in sexual glands too.",7,164
5423,which salt and sugar waste product molecules are you referring to?,1,11
5424,"So what's your point?. ah.. ok so that's why you ate them.. got it.. Get some oysters if you can eat them everyday, it would chelate metals even faster according to AV but you won’t have brain fog or any side effects",5,42
5425,raw or high?. semen only lives some 2 weeks inside your balls.. after that they are broken down and the nutrients are reabsorbed.. yes but they do another pass of the liver/kidneys Liver and kidneys are not in the balls so another chance to excrete them when semen is broken down the nutrients/toxins (if any) get released into the blood,4,60
5426,So it's better to have very dangerous toxins in your blood with nothing to protect until they hopefully reach kidneys rather than expel them directly?,1,25
5427,are you talking about the balls themselves?. it's better to treat the main cause to begin with,2,17
5428,so is it in semen or in the balls?,1,9
5429,Semen is made by what?. because as I said semen gets recycled,2,12
5430,"Why do you recycle trash?. it's not trash lmao When it burns my urethra and inflames it sure is trash maybe you've got an std my instincts also tell me to eat pizza and cake or rape some good looking girl in the streets 😂 well there's more to it orgasm also releases a heavy prolactin spike nah I'm pretty much agnostic religious reasons I also sleep 5 hours I maximize my nightly growth hormone to increase REM sleep https://youtu.be/yLzB4hDLMos Semen retention is very dangerous long-term.. The accumulating released toxins will harm your sexual organs and you will transmit degenerated semen DNA to your offspring if you don't have prostate cancer before.. hm not really.. I read aurelius but I'm no zealot it is good.. but it is also our main biochemical control system for effort/reward.. the lower your dopamine sensitivity the more ""dopamine effect"" you get even from small things.. the main reason why I'm against having orgasms is because the dopamine release from orgasm is huge.. that causes the dopamine receptors to desensitize rapidly.. it also is exactly congruent with my lowered motivation that I observe after orgasms.. doesn’t matter I eat them fresh raw I'll give that a try thanks And I felt a HUGE difference, I’m still experimenting and this is my third week on eating 10 oysters per day you mean from the chelation?. the biggest things that affected me positively were raw egg yolks and raw liver.. Yes more energy and i feel less toxic, it’s like the best breakfast ever",13,257

Sometimes I walk everyday do you have a forest nearby?. the japanese did some studies based upon taking forest walks.. apparently these are quite beneficial.. https://time.com/5259602/japanese-forest-bathing/ Yes, I live near the woods Not central London I've been in london once six years ago.. really hated it.. such an ugly place.. so you agree that it saps energy I agree to an extent but that’s because you probably haven’t been to other locations, there are really nice areas",9,82

I've been raw carnivore for a good 2 years now so it's not like my diet changed.. but i feel way better in all aspects on SR.. yeah but that's from the closeness to your partner, not necessarily from orgasm itself 😂 nah I don't regret anything.. but I do aim to do what makes me feel the best.. and SR makes me more happy than the 30 seconds of orgasm pleasure.. lmao I do have a gf.. I mostly stick to karezza.. yep I was in the heart of the concrete jungle you overestimate your intellect you don't define the topic.. we had this discussion before you.. you should work on your ego.. It's not my intellect it's my work in compiling Aajonus work.. Instead of going on a forum and spamming questions A poor analogy.But speaking of breathing I can recommend Wim Hof In these times it is important to have a strong immune system.. Even more important than having a nice fap.. No need to gamble by over eating.. No such thing as an immune system.. Over eating raw foods is healthy and can help you heal faster Well I can say that my sex drive is higher than before after eating 10 oysters per day so far so I agree What is there to gamble in over eating in the first place Perhaps the oysters are so nutritious just because they don’t fap 😉 That’s a discussion about metabolism.. Maybe we save that for another day.",19,265
5434,"Just a coincidence when people who go on the primal diet, they urges for sex increase , while people who go on a vegan diet, well they lose it completely.. It is a sign that the body can spare the nutrients, while on vegan diet the body can't spare them so they don't get any urges.. Maybe you could go on a vegan diet, you wouldn't have to worry about any urges and you could find that lost knowledge of sexual transmutation @pinehead1 ?. And besides, the body sometimes does it for you true wet dreams while you are on no fap.. I guess the body is throwing away those vital nutrients such as zinc.. You know they are vital when body throws it away when you sleep.. @pinehead1 and I covered your dopamine argument already That is just an abnormality when you have masturbated too much.. The body knows perfectly well how to recycle semen.. Not abnormality, that is the body doing what is best for it but people are being too ignorant to understand.. The same thing happens with people who don't masturbate at all.. Different ages Horniness depends on the individuals sex organs.. There's wide variance.. And yes, there's also wide difference between each tribes sexual behavior But those semen are binded to toxins that the body wants to dump, when on a healing diet like Primal, urine and feces will be used to expel toxins, which doesn't naturally happen on healthy animals.That's why some tribes could eat shit and live.. The shit from healthy animals is predigested food and full of beneficial bacteria.. Also, Aajonus commented that swallowing semen from a detoxing man may lead to vomiting, sometimes the cum may even smell of burning iron Interesting.. I retract my statement that it’s from excessive self pleasure habits but still regard it as an abnormality from a naturalistic point of view.",16,315
5435,"And raw honey?. We're not living in a natural world.. And as we're moving towards transhumanism we'll live less and less.One has to do unnatural things to get back to optimal health, like; juicing excessively, hours of hot bathing, suppositories, eating excessive amounts of food, eating all the time.. All these things would be rare luxuries for people before us.. So yes, it's an abnormality for naturalistic point of view, but things also change and fluctuate in nature and sometimes may come to be seen as abnormal 😂😂😂 Maybe you are happier and you have more energy.. But they are telling that ejaculating detox poisons off your body.. That makes you feel tired.. But improves your long term health.Primal diet is not easy because it focuses on detoxifying..

Modern humans are only constantly horny because our overly sexualized modern culture.. Animals in nature only think about sex during mating season.. Masturbating is defintely unnatural, it's degenerate Nope, people get even more horny when they go on the diet.. Only vegans have no sexual urges, the more your health degenerates the less you want to procreate And he is not talking about having sex, he is talking about masturbation.. When Aajonus went to those tribes who only ate raw fish and coconut cream, they were having sex, it was done there for fun.. My point is we have overly sexualized minds and therefore libido.. In nature as a male your mind is more consumed with achieving and maintaing alpha dominance, resources, etc.. These things give you access to more sex You wouldn't have sex without achieving  these things first, they are primary No celeb, those tribes are having sex whenever they wish.. They function completely different.. In certain tribes man have even more then one wife.. Work towards stopping completely.. There’s much to gain with the lost knowledge of sexual transmutation..

Just like prophet Mohammad allah peace be upon him And I didn’t say never have sex I was talking about masturbation If it ever works out for you let me know..

He doesn't acknowledge that perhaps it is the toxic cooked fats causing the problem.. Look how skinny and frail he looks, yet his mind is somewhat sharp but in a rambling crazy guy kinda way.. That is the product of carbohydrate based energy, caffeine, and hormonal supplements like pregnenolone/progesterone, and thyroid Ray Peat seems knowledgeable with some things, mostly biochemistry though which is chicken scratch, you dont need biochemistry knowledge to become optimal Got stuck in the cycle of trying supplements like a guinea pig in need of excitement..

He had ED issue and then 2.. When he got it up he felt nothing when his dick was inside, it was so desensitised and sex was not enjoyable.. He was never vegan nor primal, he ate a lot of fat and steaks with rice potatoes vegetables etc but after he stopped fapping for 3 months his dick got so sensitive that he now finally enjoys sex with a girl Anyway you will see after months of semen retention on primal diet when the symptoms manifest..

""When on a good healing, mainly raw carnivore, diet (such as the Primal Diet by Aajonus Vonderplanitz), a phenomenon happens that makes semen retention more detrimental than on a standard diet.. It may seem paradoxal, but the explanation is simple again.That is because this kind of diet enables to get rid of the toxicity (such as airborne heavy metal pollution) stored in glands, including sexual glands.There is a ""dumping"" phenomenon, where MORE toxins are released from where they are stored, because the body is confident from the good nutrition it receives to handle it through chelation, and can afford some damage with plenty of rebuilding raw fats and proteins.Now there is no more choice as they get lined up to be pushed out of the exit.. When this takes place, the concentration of liberated toxins will increase.. This is like opening the cage of the beast when you have the level.. You must deal with it right there.This usually takes months of semen retention (even with some relapses).If they are not expelled (by ejaculation) beyond that point, you will get increasing symptoms:""",8,199

In nature a baby is not going to down like 1 litre of milk in one go , it would suck on the mothers tit throughout the day Another useful tactic could be sipping on a baby’s milk bottle 🍼 Yes a tablespoon a day is how I did it at first cuz I had issues in the beginning, slowly adjust until you’re able to drink like 1-2 litres a day.. Also don’t drink cold milk, if you keep it in the fridge aajanus  said to leave it out for 6 hours until it gets warm or 1-2 days if you want to make kefir It would depend, i started drinking milk huge amounts at the start, did not experience any bad symptoms, if you would you might want to lower the amount, but you would have to see and decide for yourself Cool!.

I was also thinking of doing a kefir, what do you guys think about that?. Better to start with it or should I start stright with milk?. Nika When you start to drink raw milk and if you experience certain symptoms like bloating it is the minerals binding with toxins in your gut, you might want to lower the consumption if they are too harsh but you still would want to drink it and let the milk do its thing, after some time, the bloating or other problems would disappear.. Milk is important and really helpful on this diet.",8,129

I still do zero carb (I don't want to, but my body hates everything else).. I am trying to find a way!. :) I know I will, because I couldn't drink it since I was 9 yo..

Why you sear Bitchy afffg fix your brain ?. Butter doesnt work like cream, cream coats the nerves, butter doesnt I just raised the concern because sweet bread is very high in purines, and if someone is on a keto or carnivore diet they have a high excretion of ketones and they compete with the purines , so as a result that can cause urate kidney stones.. Which could result in harm.. But for primal people it’s fine it’s just that Nika  I dont know whether you’re still doing zero carb or what, I thought I’d just point it out there",16,240

(I am also breaking rules, because I haven't read a book yet, but I will!) Nah I only mentioned this because Yuri experienced this guys i ate a huge kefir milkshake you're welcome, also note my friend Bozon has something to say suck it macdonalds and your bullshit Hello everyone.. I am 25 years old, female.. I stuggle with IBD, ulcerative colitis that started to show all of the sudden 2 years ago, after as was vegetarian for around 8 years and then vegan on and off for 3 years.. I somehow naturally transited to meat (someone told me to try it and I was desperate enough for my mental vegan perception that I actually did it) and I felt relief of terrible pain in which I was 24/7.. I couldn't sleep before and I was having attacks twice per week and I ended up on IV.. Anyhow, back to meat.. I found out that meat is the only thing that doesn't cause me to be in terrible pain, but I still have some kind of discomport from time to time.. I eat just meat for 1 year and 7 months.. I naturally started to eat less and less cooked and using less and less salt.. Currently I eat raw, but sometimes I quickly sear it and it is 95% raw still.. I was doing a PKD for 3 months (Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet), where I was able to eat fat:protein 2:1 (so every 100 g of lean meat, 30 g of fat), and all together I consumed only 300g of it (that was my allowance), no eggs allowed, so I started to lose weight and I also lost my period with it.. It worked fine for my pain as long as I did it, but now I just finished it and I would like to reintroduce some foods, especially raw eggs, since I have my own chickens who doesn't consume corn.. Is here anyone who had similar experience, has/had IBS/IBD?. It feels like that I am never going to heal completely.. They also diagnosed me with Lyme in Germany and I have many bloodtests, so they say that my ulcerative colitis is actually gastrointestial manifestation of lyme disease.. I don't know to hlbe honest with you and I don't care, I just want to live normally, without pain.. thicker and tastier if you switch milk for kefir in the recipe its a fucking breakfast in a cup.... i drank one kilo of milkshake last night becuase i was too lazy to prepare meat But 6 is primal so he’s fine",28,580

Kefir-fermented milk- clabered milk, i would call them the same To not spit it but to drink some, squish it in your mouth and then spit it back so i'm planning on spitting into the quart and adding 2 spoons of unheated honey the best out there i dont know about that, he just said that spiting might not be enough, so when you squish it in your mouth you get more bacteria\ and you do not want to leave the milk in the sun right?. put it in a dark spot.. right now it is summer here, so it should ferment quicker Because if you would, it will become bitter, because of different strands of bacteria i dont think plastic leaches into milk that much.. milk isn't acidic enough to leach the plastic.. the last time i made homemade fermented milk it had more of the fermented fat taste instead of sweeet, even though i put honey in it yes and didn't he say to spit into it instead of using kefir grains?. since it is your ""own bacteria""",12,327

I have liquid form but can get the fermented one I live with idiots, wouldn’t even entertain telling them to change cleaner Fermented honey ?.

It happens the same way with cheese.. Bloating that would happen from dairy, it is nothing new, aajonus knew really well that going true the detoxification even in smaller amounts would eventually stop it, and you would be able to eat dairy again.. Vilt my point is that just because someone has more symptoms or signs of detox e.g from raw milk, doesn’t mean that it’s more detoxing than eating raw meat and animal fat tissue.. If you heal and regenerate quicker that clearly means that you’re detoxing aswell..... why conflict the terms ?. Raw meat and fat is more detoxing than raw milk",9,210
5530,"You ever think that Sv3rige have no experience and little knowledge level compared to Aajonus ?. Yeah i would do that It is ok to not understand everything, dont worry And it is a problem because it is too detoxing I already said it phil, raw meat and raw animal fat is more healing regenerating, but some people would get problems only going the second group option, and would need to add vegetable juices and dairy Someone at this group said that milk causes his tongue to be white and it smells until he scrapes it off No",2,98
5531,"Does the white stuff cause bad breath?. The same is with white tongue, its not a candida, that is another part where sv3rige lies about, it is the minerals in the mouth binding with toxins in the mouth, and you dont want to get rid of it",2,47
5532,"Vilt lets say we have 2 people .. 1 persons only ate raw dairy, butter, cream and milk etc and the other one ate plenty of raw meat with animal fat tissue aswell as organs.. Who would detox more and heal faster?. Can you see where I’m coming from when you said “milk is more detoxing than raw meat and animal fat tissue”?. Aajonus had huge experience, and he knew that bad symptoms from drinking raw dairy was from detox, and he knew really well these things, more then any other member, sv3rige or 6 would tell you.. If you would keep drinking it, even in lower amounts, the detoxification would end evetually and people would be able to drink milk normaly without any symptoms again.. Phil And Gatis is an interesting guy , always had been a truther , even when he started making videos I corrected Vilt^ Yep AV did say they were superior to dairy He believes in a realm , not a flat earth Phil And for some remedies and disease you cant do anything without dairy or raw unsalted cheese Nope vilt, if the organs and raw meat is eaten with fat from the raw meat it is more healing in all areas of the body including the gut, than cheese",7,216
5533,"Like?. Like haku, i also think it is the same with bozon.. And there is a lot more people At  first some people would have to, depending on their toxicity level",3,31
5534,"Can someone point me to where Aajonus suggests 2L+ of milk per day?. Outside of strenuous activity?. 6 You really need nut formula, dont make sv3rige mistake, i am sure he would do nut formula from time to time he would not call everyone mentaly ill or retarded if they would not agree with him Raw dairy is part of the diet and really important to it, eating cheese every 15min can make you heal your gut and body really fast, no amounts of raw meat and raw organs would ever do that they all follow raw peep and drink coffevfefe There is no primal mothers It depends, most of the babies would be healthier on raw cows milk because mothers are too toxic No, it was because of huge amounts of radiation therapy that melted the bone of his jaw because the minerals were used to bind with radiation It is for human bones, for any animal bones that can digest it lol Dairy is what remileized his bone and spine, also his jaw Yeah that makes more sense When a calf is born, his bones are not fully formed, he has lots of cartilage, the milk has huge amounts of minerals, that go into the cartilage and bone to make it hard and strong.. 6 Do some nut formula, you needed it long time ago Raw unsalted cheese with honey, it is literaly concentrated milk I knew you were having no idea what you were talking about, just trying to find a way to not say that you are wrong No, Aajnous have said it himself, dairy has the most minerals What is the argument really?. They contain different minerals",5,282
5535,You really think that organs have more minerals then milk ?. Half the shit that people say in here has no evidence,2,22
5536,"Nope, can you provide any evidence ?. Now you are just trolling",2,12
5537,"Has anyone tried this ?. Phill is only 3  months on the diet and should spend more time listening rather then writing I would rather listen to Aajonus, i am sure he had a good reason for airing it Nope, it is the milk binding with toxins, listen to more aajnous audio He was sipping",2,55
5538,"What does bloating mean?. When you stomach expands Yes i understand the word , wanted to see what he thinks* When you look like a pregnant man Haha yeah You are, not me, spend some more time listening.. If you would get bloating, you should decrease the amount of milk you drink, but to still drink it, and eventually it will be gone, and you will be able to drink larger amounts of it The same way people say, they are having alergies to drinking raw milk, most of the time it is not alergy, it just milk binding with toxins in the gut and causing unwanted symtpoms ^ Bloating IS a sign of detox.. He would also do a few days of only drinking raw milk and raw eggs, so you are not right about that statement I have gotten bloating from animal products, after weight-loss cycle I have stayed somewhat swollen.. Because these things are not as detoxing as milk.. He recommended 1-2 quarts (litres) for people who are active, he did it too from time to time.",6,180

As our final condition.... Primal Diet™ is a transition diet to optimal health.Dairy and eggs should still be part of regular eating if one stays within industrial societal conditions.. Yes, but it still should be drinked and eventually the bloating would go away.. Too much milk would cause you to have too harsh of detoxification You seriously need to eat, eat, eat.. Eat raw animal products Bloating is a sign that milk binds with toxins in the gut.. I gotten honey heated above 93 F that still crystallized..

Sip.Bloating may be a sign of extreme toxicity that need to be arrested, water diluting toxins.. yes Even if you would not stay withing the industrial conditions, you still have to remove old stored toxins, vaccines damage is permanent.. I had some not aired meat and it did not have any effect That doesn’t make any sense Because meat organ and fat are more rebuilding and regenerative.. I remember he said it didn't taste so good but it did have a potent effect clearly.. He said it tasted so bad he should throw it away but i don't remember he said anything about airing it.. U can clearly see he was pretty high on that stream playing guitar and stuff but maybe it's also the sun because he also looked burned.. Probably combination of both He said that probably when he was eating it himself but then in another live after that I think he took it out form the fridge in Germany and didn’t bother, he said it ain’t worth it You seem leetle angry Min 58:35 https://youtu.be/piQ94jb3ySI Anna disappeared lol When did he recommend this?. Show me ?. Because in one of his recent lives sv3rige came back to Germany and took out high meat from the fridge which was not aired for like 3 months, he opened and tried it and then said there’s no point of eating this he might aswell throw it away, he said it’s not worth it and better to air it",11,268

Eating moldy berries will give you detox symptoms whereas eating large amounts of oysters would be even better for detoxing than moldy berries and yet comes with no side effects.. Oysters are more detoxing than moldy berries for heavy metals....this is clarified by AV We all were talking about bloating being a sign of detox or not at the start.. Vilt Pawel This doesn't relate to dairy and bloating.. Aajonus said himself that quicker health was achieved with cow dairy consumption.. It makes a lot of sense *grabs a milkshake and sips while you debate* The mold growing on moldy berries is specifically ""engineered"" to chelate with heavy metals that oysters couldn't bind and chelate with as quickly as with eating oysters.. Milk ain’t more detoxing than raw meat and animal fat tissue, there’s a reason why av said animal fat tissue was superior Some people who would be on the diet cant even drink milk because it is too detoxing for them.. but they dont get any detox symtpoms from raw meat or raw fat Offcourse i am joking) Milk is detoxing food...From goat milk that I consumed I experienced serious vomiting two mornings in a row.. I vomited cottage cheese out and second morning it was pink cottage cheese.. The milk had binded with toxins that were dumped to stomach and quickest way out was vomiting.. My digestion with fermented milk is getting better , i’ll try to sip every few min and see how it is Gather more knowledge and you will understand ^ I just gave you an example of oysters and moldy berries Think about it Bozon, bozon cant even drink raw milk Why Because it is too detoxing for him It was debunked by me The mold growing on moldy berries is specifically ""engineered"" to chelate with heavy metals that oysters couldn't bind and chelate with as quickly as with eating oysters.. The same is for haku, when he sips raw milk he gets really bloated or bloating problems No but in was in response to the statement of saying milk detoxes more than raw meat and raw animalFat tissue Yes, each food has its specific need in a specific circumstance if one wants to achieve natural health the quickest way.. wow milk fed only veal im jealous He believes that the earth is flat, and calls everyone mentaly ill who doesnt agree with him.. While survives of goverment and people donations at the same time calling them slaves Phil I am giving you real life examples when milk is done detoxing, people dont get problems from drinking it, because it is high in minerals, those minerals are binding and are used to bind with toxins in the body and in the gut, that is the whole reason, real life examples that happen to people No parasites has eyes and a mouth like that, just eat the damm fish.. You can also cut open that smaller other fish, and see the organs",18,569
5548,Like what ?. How are you feeling man like nausea,2,10
5549,"what does it mean?. A lot of people would think they have alergies for milk but it would not be alergies, it would just be toxins binding with the milk, and even if you would have a real milk allergy, he would still say to drink milk but in less amounts The answer is in the book",2,57

Eating them causes your body to dump a lot of toxins in the gut.. Good thing you ate it with raw unsalted cheese, so the toxins would get absorbed That would explain your nausea Alon ya thx maybe ill ferment the milk?or it doesnt matter About nausea, i think it would help give it a try.. +1👆🏻1 semicooked meal a week to slow down detox, Aajonus said",7,103
5556,Where ?. Q&A,2,3
5557,"what aajonus say about someone who react bad to cow milk?. Fat should also not be a worry, because the toxins would be encased in there and when you would eat it, it would just pass true but if its muscle meat just eat it and if its organs and you're worried dont eat it",2,55
5558,"is not that supermarket meat is vaccinated ?. If that's all you can get, do it, but always keep searching for better sources.. Long-term they'll start becoming more and more detrimental.. Right now I'm getting bad reactions from caged factory farmed eggs.. Can't go back below free range eggs anymore.Same I've noticed with meat.. I can't eat factory farmed beef since it causes a disgusting feeling in me.. In the uk organic and free range eggs are absolute trash, I felt so good when I ate raw eggs from Ukraine, big difference.. Even organic eggs in the uk are vaccinated against salmonella It’s so dumb The drugs and vaccines dont collect in meat, so you should be fine.. But FInland man put it really well, try to always find better sources.. Eggs i would not touch, i pressume you would feel it yourself It sucks, but you have good dairy, so it should help you in gaining weight.. In that Article Aajonus writes that he cant even gain weight without dairy Yeah eggs are trash in the uk , I experienced eating 10 raw eggs a day in Ukraine for 1 month and then when I came back to England.. I felt so sick from British eggs, couldn’t breathe... then realised that eggs in the uk are vaccinated This happened 2 years ago Find what eggs work the best.. In Finland free range are the best.. Organic eggs are fed soy and kept inside most of the time, they're actually worse than free-range I don’t care much about if it’s organic or free range.. There’s no point of eating eggs here as they are heavily vaccinated Salmonella is supposed to cure us, their vaccines destroy salmonella This is why I eat a heavy amount of oysters as I know they’re untouched And raw dairy Fat If i ever come to uk, i will definitely try dairy, i had found bad dairy and good dairy, once i had a batch of raw milk that smelled really good, hard to describe it, but it only happened once I also heard that dairy in switzerland is really good Yeah raw dairy in the uk is solid.. I had a similar experience when i visited the UK.. The eggs were horrible.. I need to research a bit more about uk laws that apply to small businesses and farms aswell as industrial businesses e.g supermarkets I’m gunna find out if it’s all vaccinated and legal to sell unvaccinated",19,413

5565,"how many days do you leave it in the dark cupboard?. The best tasting fermented milk for me is the one where it is already curdled and whey separated.. how do you do that yeah the one i buy has that.. i can see the whey in a different layer I had milk that was like kefir where you buy from shop, i did not like it, It seemed not done fermeted yet and there is a ""frothy"" layer mine isn't from a shop.. it's more like a farmer's market / food coop.. it's much better than store bought which seems more like a yogurt As many days as it takes to ferment.. Some days it takes 1, some 3.",7,120
5566,"do you just take a sip to see if it is done fermenting?. If you want separated milk to be that, you can use a blender.. Or that other type of blender I would say you know its done fermenting when whey seperate, at least that how i look at it i'll send a photo later to compare with what i have fermenting at home for about a day and a half so far.. i like the ""chunky milkshake"" texture with a sparkling mouthfeel.. it's ""chunky"" but not slow to pour like yogurt is.. it moves around easily like a liquid but looks all frothy 😂😂",6,106

5585,"So eating cooked sometimes makes you not primal?. Eating cooked introduces 32 toxins in to the system, and i would not say sometimes.. Cooking is not primal, the whole diet revolves around eating raw and he has not been making videos for some time Not really, if you’re having a hard detoxification cooked starch with plenty of raw fats helps alleviate harsh detoxication I am talking about meat not starch, it is also the same with starch maybe he changed and now primal Also cooked starch is the last resort, give me a sec i will find it Not really, firstly he said to first try nut formula and see if it works, only then to move to cooked starches and do it in really small amounts, more as a medicine It still does the job.... It does at a price still works.... https://www.wewant2live.com/quality-or-quantity/ Phil I undestand that some people have to eat cooked starch because no other raw starch or starch in the meat or vegetable juices, nut formula does work, that is fine.. I was talking about eating cooked meat and other cooked foods.. At least you eat cooked starch for a good reason and other people too.. Also Aajonus was saying that it is should only be needed for 2 years on the diet after that you dont need it anymore I agree cooked meat isn’t primal, but my point was that sometimes when you’re undergoing a harsh detoxification and raw starch makes it harder for you to digest then cooked starch like potatoes with plenty of raw butter can alleviate harsh symptoms of detoxification.. Aajanus said this in his Q&a Yes, i would also eat cooked starch if i would be in a huge pain and nothing else would work.. Those cooked starches may also alleviate symptoms because the processing of cooked starch needs the nutrients and enzymes that would've gone to detoxing and rebuilding the affected area.I've gone through many deliberating detoxes and haven't needed any cooked foods, meat, or starch.. All other protocols have worked for me and I haven't resorted to cooked starch yet.. Yes, that could also be the truth, and maybe going true some pain, would do your body good but this is not a group Same for me So what, it still does the job, aajanus vouched for it in his Q&a i just saw the vid where he made that aajonus chicken recipe.. and of course his time with sc3rige It still works....

Try etsy get wood n tools Aajonus was against fasting-starving.. It has nothing to do with detoxification, if you are not supplying your body with nutrients to deal with toxins, they might even start to cause damage and deterioration.. Doing you the opposite in terms of health and making you spend more years on the diet to get the same results that you could got not starving.. What you should think about is over eating.. There might be spiritual aspect to not eating, unfortunately i am more worried about health.. There's also a spiritual aspect to eating moderately, but those teachings are not aligned with present day and the industrial society and its consequences which brought tremendous amounts of toxins.I also suspect that the corrupt kings and leaders wanted the populace to eat moderately, while they gorged on food.. pwned",10,169

The bacteria in it have predigested it for you.. One can also make piimä/kefir by putting their own spit or honey as starter culture.2.. Warming the milk.. Letting the milk warm up in room temperature (if it has been chilled or in the refrigerator) for 6-12 hours so it's not cold.. Cold milk is harder to digest.3.. Obtaining fresh warm raw milk.. No chilling process is done to the milk.. Straight from the udder pretty much.. Fresh warm milk has properties of regenerating nerve cells and contains bioavailable growth hormone.4.. Drinking A2 milk from a heritage breed.. Also the cows having their horns in place and not sawed off affects the quality of the milk.5.. Drinking from a single cow.. The milk from a single cow is easier for our body to recognize and utilize.6.. Pastured cows milk is better than grain-fed cows milk7.. Lamb, goat, camel, reindeer or other raw milk may also be better for some When I drink cold milk I get this.. It never happened before until recently.. I eat small fishes whole Meat is not a store for much toxins Bon apetit Mr Haku Aajanus put great emphasis on E.. coli, trichinosis and salmonella etc In the uk eggs in supermarkets have red lion labels on them and codes,  and their policy clearly states the purpose of the vaccine.. It is to deliberately eradicate salmonella and all types of bacteria which they think is “harmful”",23,275
5599,Where are you from?Ask the butchery man?. That’s how you approach the fish 😂 And raw foods are always safe to eat raw because the body can deal with the toxins since it recognizes them inside the cells.. When it's cooked they become free radicals.. Eat with plenty of fat Eat with your hands🥴 looks delicous,4,56
5600,Why would you eat an egg that has been vaccined with a purpose to destroy salmonella which is very important?. no idea bro Honey has the property of turning meat into fuel or solvent too rofl eat your meat with lots of fat buddy thats the rule Cream hinders digestion of meat since it has a tendency to coat it.. All other fats work splendid with meat.Always extra fats with meat meals and always put lemon juice on your armpits or else the girls will run away from you,3,89
5601,"How do u feel with it?. im drinking a milkshake with banana, because im a banana bitch-boy Yes If aajanus was alive and saw what kind of vaccine they use in the uk that destroys all bacteria in the egg he wouldn’t recommend it I doubt it considering i did it from the start so i ate the pastured (but very likely soy fed) chicken breast and i didn't have a bad reaction.. it didn't taste as good as the soy free ones though it gives you parasites that heal the gut thats why i think they are soy fed.. cuz they were cheaper, and didn't taste as egg yolky as the soy fed ones",4,115
5602,"Yes 😬Isn't it better in paper?. soy free chicken breast is over $20 per lb :( Closing your eyes and focusing again yeah well i need a good cost effective available source of white meat instead of always eating red.. i do fish too but it's gotten expensive.. anyone eat white fish like cod?. i usually eat tuna or wild caught salmon Raw eggs heal leaky gut, form mucus to protect gut.. Also butter+honey soothes intestines.. Milkshakes also form mucus to heal leaky gut aajonus says that even supermarket eggs are ok for the short term.the worse he saw is someone get receeding gums.its better then nothing.. If the raw eggs are vaccinated it will do the opposite.. Even if the chicken is on a quality diet, organic and free range",9,131
5603,Do you have your own garden?. Find small families who raise their chickens for themselves I’m trying to do this in the uk I’ve recently tried stopping drinking cold milk too Yeah they detox through their eggs,2,37
5604,"guys, when you put fresh raw milk in refrigerator, for how long it will last?. I would let it ferment and then put it in the fridge, I wouldn’t put fresh milk in the fridge for days",2,37
5605,"but since you put it in, how many days it's okay to drink it?. The moment that egg gets a 💉, it’s game over my friend",2,26
5606,"Who has experience with cheese train?. i ran out of eggs last week becuase i ate so many..... now im back with 60 more https://www.facebook.com/jodiemarshofficial/videos/1430232677070599/?vh=e Yeah that’s true goats milk isn’t for someone to consume if they’re thin I think it is not great in general, you cant gain weight with it it doesnt calm you down Watch the video I posted  aajanus said goat milk is good for people with diabetes and who are overweight if someone is overweight AND has diabetes Phil.. If you are thin and have diabetes then No goat milk That’s exactly what I said above yes, my bad, i was thinking why would you be asking if he was diabetic, it would only matter if he would be overweight I was just curious So I've been implementing some raw carbohydrates, fruit & ramen noodles and I've noticed a lot better energy You could also look up where Aajonus was talking about goat milk",4,159
5607,Isn’t ramen noodles like heavily processed?,1,6
5608,You eat it everyday ?. Yeah pretty much.. If I get tired of it I'll eat something else The fruit is pretty good raw ramen noodles?. those are toxic,4,29
5609,"does anyone know if the micronutrient composition of foods in their ""high"" form is changed?. Nice.. I think Aajonus said that would help detox the cooked ramen noodles stored in your body.. I mean if you cook them then yeah but you can eat them raw.. They just are kinda crunchy The fruit is easier to eat Yeah but I eat it raw he talked about eating moldy grains to detox, not raw grains.. If you are thin you should not consume goats milk and stay away from it, cows milk is always the best it relaxes the nerves while goats doesn't.20060910LA 00:42:13 And goat milk wont calm you down, you wont be able to gain weight you might attract some primal gals while you're at it.... the other day i was lemoning up outdoors and i noticed a beautiful woman watching me.... she was like ""hey milkbitch, whassup?"" and I told her about Aajonus and lemon juice and now she is my wife.. don't eat the skin, it's indigestible",9,170
5610,"I recently found a source for fresh never frozen organs, been eating as much kidney heart and especially liver as possible.. Now I have chronic fatigue, could the fresh organs be causing detox or what?. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Bruuuh I swear you’re the funniest guy I’ve heard on this primal chat Your reaction is priceless👌 Did you eat it with plenty of raw fat?whats the quality of the source?. You need to be more careful with organs than muscle meats, if you buy it from a shit source Not with plently of fat, just a few bites of butter and heart fat.. It's grassfed beef, for the first time liver doesn't burn my throat so I'm sure this is good quality.. Lemme show you show you from aajanus Q&a 1 sec They could also go in to repairing your body, so you might feel fatigue If you say it’s chronic eat some nut formula and if that doesn’t work out then boil some potatoes without the skin and and wait until the potatoes have cooled down a bit.. And then get your raw butter and put it inside a cup.. Get the cup and put it inside a big bowl filled with hot water but not boiling water, dip your finger in there and if you  can hold it for more than 5 seconds then it’s a fine temp.. Wait like 5 mins and it will melt the butter into liquid.. Pour it over the potatoes and mix He does not need that He already is eating lots of cooked rice with raw egg I see привет анна добро пожаловать Aajanus said that goat milk would be perfect for some who is diabetic and overweight,",10,283
5611,"Are you diabetic alon?. Overweight yes, but not diabetic first time hearing it i would say the high version of that organ would make you detox This fucking dog lmao, if only the owners wouldn’t give it “dog treats” and gave it real food then it wouldn’t fucking choke 😂 or the juice of moldy grains Gotta do it though so now I need to load my body with bacteria ecoli to go into the brain",2,76
5612,Grendel do you put the salty seasoning on your dry noodles?. No man those are toxic Too much salt That's disgusting Why feed the troll Loooool,2,26
5613,"because ramen noodles don't count as food ;) get it get it???. I don't care about these things much, i know they are toxic Those ramen noodles burn really well Pleas...",2,31
5614,What’s your diet like on a daily basis?. eat the poop and piss of bacteria.. no shit dude!. I've been eating fish 3 times a day with eggs and milk.. It's been working really good I was jk about the ramen haha 🤪😉 i like you better as a troll Grendel,5,51
5615,"Did you eat the worm bro?. Vilt I'm hungry feed me please Yeah it definitely makes me detox.. 😬🤢 I also tried a glandular thyroid supp for a while.. also a synthetic t3/t4 combo.. aajonus said ""brain cancer"" on thyroid supplements Nice monkey pfp David",5,45
5616,Oh okay so you’re supposed to eat the moldy raw ramen noodle juice?. yes,2,14
5617,"Grandel, for real you are saying this ?. 😂 They are cooked and dried, they are not raw I knew it I was gunna say this after having a few thoughts of it, makes sense",2,35
5618,"Omg what do I have to do to convince you.. Do you want to hear me eating them?. they have things like oxidized iron in it but of course, you can find studies that show DMSO is good.. same with DHEA.. Grendel What you need is raw brain, you know, to help you.",5,53
5619,"lol trollmode?. I just ate them on camera Gotta do it for the detox 🤘😔 i'm glad i didn't go through with using lugol's iodine more than a handful of times.. DHEA i did a bit more times, it is TOXIC DHEA is TOXIC, it stores in the NERVE ENDINGS!!!. Relax bro 😌 it's raw Is it white powder ?. I think i have used it a few times, not good, i will have to get it out i used it in a DMSO solution...but yeah white powder or capsules too.. i've taken DMSO supplements, so i've gone through my retarded phase.. we used to eat those dry noodles in elementary school Yes, but avocado is used as a solvent and for fuel dude.... just think logical about it?. how it is produced?. who is getting the money?. What substances are in it?. etc.... Even Avocado?. It's alkaline ,  thought no mixing like 5 hours easy i have it after a meat meal and can go hours without eating it doesnt really feel different to me whether it's mixed or not.. mixed tastes a bit better though Huh maybe your right because after shaking I had a thick layer of in mixed butter on top of the lube fluid you can put honey in the mouth if it doesn't blend with jsut shaking/whipping blenders are man made and satanic -sv3rige Used two duck eggs tribal people didn't have blenders when they made lubrication formula 🤤 I did lube formula for first time today, put way too much honey but I feel great No blender I think so.",15,267
5620,Blending with a fork and shaking in a jar good enough?. but blended could add EMFs,2,16
5621,how much butter in that?,1,5
5622,"damn.. after a meat meal?. i will use a fork to whip/blend it.. i've done that too.. didnt really notice a differnece.. maybe better taste since everything goes together it will mix in my stomach i usually drop the egg in the butter without blending.. then add lemon.. then take spoon of honey in the mouth, and then chug the liquid butter mix oh you mean in the stomach they mix but the lemon and honey aren't in there for long though",8,82
5623,"what is it about the lubrication formula that gets the fats into those areas though?. is it because it is such a large amount of fat?. what is the purpose of the lemon juice?. more rebuilding instead of detoxing like coconut cream you can use butter or coconut cream.. butter probably better though since it's animal fat.. per the book use coconut cream instead of dairy cream 6 and vilt should fight at a meat up yeah,....just like he said to make ice cream with the DON-VEE-AYYYYY blenders are for vegans - sv3rige i use fork.. These stories help my detox better I remember my ex girlfriend, (halfLithuanian half Russian), she visited Lithuania and she stayed at her grandmas living near the forests.. And they brought back kilos and kilos of blueberries like an insane amount lol Mine were a day in fridge",8,143
5624,ReallyHow comes?. Vilt are you going to try this soon?. The moldy Berry detox imagine if they had bee pollen too.. that's the real magical stuff for pain apparently Moldy Berry detox I bought em yday and was in fridge overnight and already got mould on Nah store shit prolly pesticide ridden anyway I wonder how thy got mouldy Didn’t see much just picked one or 2 out eest look good,4,71
5625,Reckon the rest would be alright lmao?,1,7
5626,Will lube formula not be as magical if  I use cream in place of butter?. Found found a mouldy blueberry in my packet and picked it out,2,27
5627,"they would eat it before drinking vodka right?. So this shows how intelligent aajanus was even though he was from America Yes animal products was a cure, all these modern processed inventions were all alien to people in Eastern Europe until western modernisation slowly spread to the east And my great grandparents who were growing up and theirs from the 1800s/1900s used it aswell That’s why when I saw aajanus recipe i got excited cuz I’ve seen the recipe before Polish version is different but my family’s and ancestors always made raw eggs, honey, lemon juice and raw butter and mixed it.. I used to drink this every week growing up as a child from birth And the reason why they used that formula was when someone was very sick, e.g had a cold/flu or to get strong or to not get so drunk after drinking vodka ahahahaha So In Russia  and Ukraine they called it “Gogil mogil”.. It’s a strange funny name but they used the same ingredients, so raw honey, raw eggs, squeezed lemon juice and raw butter and they would mix it.. Aajanus never invented lubrication formula only the name of the formula ""humans in nature don't use blenders"" - sv3rige all hail sv3rige ""blenders are for making vegan sludge"" - sv3rige Yeah especially women.. It was a strategy for women to use to avoid getting easily drunk at parties David  all the fat would protect you and minimise the damage from the alcohol that’s why aajanus talked about the french, where people in France ate a heavy ton of cheeses and fat before they would drink About 10L and gonna ordercsome just been shopping about for decent quality ones",6,283
5628,They last fresh for longer ?,1,6
5629,"what about vitamin d?. no worries, your comment above made me lol too bro I wondered the same thing as fresh liver gets me higher than high liver",2,28
5630,So now you are egg man also?,1,7
5631,"Is there something this guy can’t do?. catch me fermenting milk on the daily I see you find it hard to get animalFat tissue sometimes too much butter at once can cause some discomfort.. Ty milk man i pray that i never run out of eggs ever again Be careful milky Me too I always drink 7°C milk and don't have problems I make sure I consciously breathe through my nose and I never mouth breathe (unless I have sleep apnea that I’m not aware of) and I sniff really hard to breathe I did for ages but definitely getting respiratory reactions Can’t really find any unsalted cheese For example, K2 vitamin goes up in fermented foods Some nutrients go down, some up",3,123
5632,does anyone know if fermenting food changes the micronutrient composition?. Or just makes them more bioavailable?. i want it for myself first hehehe 👌 Who wouldn't want smarter and healthier future for their children Respiratory reactions even at room temperatureCheese 10min before and 20 after My problem is worse.. I can't reprogramme my wife.... 😅 +1 If I had glass bottles I’d just leave it in those out of fridge How haha I thought it was 9 I can’t set temp of fridge any higher than 6 And only just started putting it to room temp put it was stored cold,5,101
5633,"Well I have increased energy?. Maybe you get these problems, because the eggs are vaccinated and soy fed.. I am sure if you would try good eggs you would not get these problems",3,33
5634,"I’m sure I wouldn’t if I had good eggs however currently they work just fine for me how I consume them and I know plenty of people who are thriving consuming them the way I do?. Lmao John eats then this way and I believe is probably more educated than yourself Ok mate Truth but not everything in the book is correct,m",2,62
5635,"I’ve already said I don’t particularly agree that you have to consume whole eggs?. Why dont you say what you dont agree with, rather then saying this I am sure you will find something, if you have a car that would be even easier Lithuania is like russia and  Ukraine, people locally don’t vaccinate , but in the uk it’s so hard to find and I’m still on a quest searching.. Wow you’re so gone of course I know the bible is full of lies Lmaooooo Lmao I could argue everything in the bible is correct but it doesn’t make it fact",3,102

5639,What kind of argument is that ?. 🔥=🧯,2,8
5640,How’s it not an argument?. He said the people are wrong and not educated whilst I’d argue John is educated?. It’s best to have unripe as there are more enzymes yes or eat some pineapple/papaya afterwards Vilt Get of your high horse man You think I’m apologising to you are you fucking retarded?. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Yeah so much mate,4,58
5641,"And insulting my by calling me English?. Your making ridiculous claims and don’t even know me?.

5644,"lol you can sell them in the uk.. Blueberries non organic are so damn expensive.. Connor 🇬🇧 how much are they?. Like £2.50-£3.00 for like 300g?.
