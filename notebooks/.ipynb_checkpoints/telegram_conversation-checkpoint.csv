Deleted Account,09:01,I’ve always found that funny
Unknown,09:01,"As in, something doesn’t seem right with that statement"
Deleted Account,09:02,you can go through 36h of fast depleting glycogen stores. And technicaly only after this pont fasting starts.
Deleted Account,09:38,"for me its a tool to rest the digestive system, going through candida die-off and its over 70 toxins beeing released is a lot of work for the liver, kidneys and gut"

Silmavi,15:36,Cheese and honey btw meals?
Unknown,15:36,Sounds good
Unknown,15:36,Just cheese is faster

Unknown,15:37,Ok
Deleted Account,15:37,Sounds like eating all day long🤔
Silmavi,15:37,No fasting....

Deleted Account,15:39,It depends on type of your metabolism also.
Silmavi,15:40,when you eat it alone?
Unknown,Unknown,
Silmavi,15:42,Good idea to eat it once wuth honey and once alone
Unknown,15:43,My kids eat it with the meal.They aren't at home btw meals
Unknown,15:43,I will do it during week end
Deleted Account,15:44,Yesterday I had nausea after several hours passed from second meal.Today I had zero hunger until 20h+ passed after previous that meal
Unknown,15:45,Today I made only one typical meal enhanced with 4 egg yolks
Unknown,15:46,So they ate clay? Act Charcoal will do the job?
Unknown,15:48,"4,5 h passed I feel neutral, zero hunger and body warmed itself to confort temperature. Before meal I felt colder than normal."
Unknown,15:49,Thx Ring
Silmavi,15:53,So when you have enough fat you feel nausea if you eat it?
Deleted Account,15:57,"So guys, water=bad?"
Silmavi,15:59,I have dry skin even if i drink twice lubrication formula
Unknown,16:07,Is there a limit in drinking lubrication firmula to get some fat?
Deleted Account,17:22,@ubeats1 could you please advice any source/book/literature about detoxification? Besides Aajonuse's books?
Deleted Account,19:08,"Funny, just yesterday I committed myself to eating way more fat. I’ve always had trouble digesting/utilizing (cooked) fat throughout my life. Also had a big problem with alcohol a few years back, very interesting to see Aajonus link those two."
Unknown,19:12,"Had a ton of fat 12 hours ago, don’t even want to think about food right now. Skin is noticeably more hydrated though"
Unknown,19:14,"I’ve had super high fat meals / nights before, just haven’t committed to it for a period of time"

Unknown,12:51,😂😂i must feel fine in this group sharing personal info that is not about  food.Good thing
Unknown,12:53,Milk is good for sex?
Unknown,12:59,I am mad at me because i got things in the wrong order.i Should have started with raw meat instead of raw veggies and i would have saved lots of health and time. When i was with veggies the world was pro meat and now i am pro meat and the world is pro veggies and grains.
Unknown,13:00,And doctors trying to kill us with medicines
Unknown,13:02,I don't know... thoughts come to my head

Deleted Account,19:39,I hate when people hear “sun gazing” and they assume it’s staring at the sun mid-day
Silmavi,19:41,What is sun gazing actually.I don want to get wrong info from Wikipedia
Deleted Account,19:50,It's very pleasant in the summer evenings. I usually sit on a rock for a couple of hours and stare at the sun. everybody thinks I've gone totally irreversably nuts
Allu,19:53,"Nice, I started making viili/filbunke from milk"
Unknown,19:53,Here in Finland I usually buy 16litres of milk per week
Deleted Account,19:56,"Aleksi, how do U make viili? 😮"
Allu,19:56,Put raw milk in some container in roomtemperature and add little bit of finnish store bought Viili or just very old fermented milk with it
Unknown,19:56,Now I'm trying with 1litre of raw milk+1pack of Viili
Silmavi,19:58,My husband just loves the viili we make with raw.milk.Best viili ever he says
Allu,19:58,

Silmavi,14:56,Can it be the warm weather?
Unknown,14:56,Warm promotes detox
Deleted Account,15:05,Superstitious in my opinion. Why would the liver know on which day it should do a special clense and with everyone on the same day?
Silmavi,15:07,Is there s calendar for every organ?

Antón Leitón,15:19,Anybody has a worm for me? 😂😂😂
Antón Leitón,15:23,
Deleted Account,15:24,The parasite I have is common in a lot of people. For some they can cause symptoms. Perhaps because they are dominating. They LOVE sugar too.
Unknown,15:25,Pretty sever.
Unknown,15:26,Severe
Unknown,15:27,"Can t poop, bloating burping all the time, rash like acne on my jawline. Even getting bloated from a bit of herbal tea or a sip of water. Bone broth and vegetable juice gave me severe pain in my jawline I remember. The symptoms are getting less now"
Unknown,15:27,When it started I vomited and was nauseous with an extreme pain in my abdominal area
Allu,15:28,"No the opposite, lot of energy today"
Deleted Account,15:29,Yeah it was upsetting because I experienced such a healthy state before that. I get really down from acne.

Deleted Account,16:09,I was eating animal based and had some mochi and pancakes here and there. Made with raw milk butter and eggs and I put honey on them.

Unknown,18:21,😂😂with drugs
Yan,18:31,"dont u think theres a reasonable chance its depending on genes to a meaningful degree, some ppl doing fairly well on plants and others dont due to lacking certain enzymes, having more of others and a bunch of other stuff"

Deleted Account,22:52,"Only good for emergency-type situations, broken bones, things like that"

Silmavi,22:54,We take advantage of them when necessary
Yan,22:57,how does one that considers a vegan diet unhealthy/toxic explain highlevel athletes that kill it while on a vegan diet(outperform everyone else that does eat alot of meat etc)
Unknown,22:57,been thinking about that
Deleted Account,22:59,Professional athletes?
Yan,22:59,"i see alot of plantbashing, yet there are people crushing all “meateaters” while eat truckloads of veggies"
Unknown,22:59,yes
Unknown,22:59,like ufc fighters for example
Unknown,22:59,performing at highest level
Unknown,22:59,on vegan diet
Deleted Account,23:00,"Didn’t know that was the case, I’m not big on ufc. Guess it depends how long they’ve been vegan for."
Yan,23:00,the diaz brothers for example
Unknown,23:01,there are a bunch
Unknown,23:01,just google vegan ufc fighters
Unknown,23:02,"i just like to play devils advocate, cos as i said i believe some ppl might do better on vegan diet than carnivore diet"
Unknown,23:02,just because it suits their bodies better

Unknown,23:11,"The one mistake i thought all diets i tried had in common was that imho, people start to get tunnelvision, similar to a religion where in their mind their believes are the truth and everyone else is wrong. Clearly carnivore diet works wonders for a lot of ppl no doubt, but the probability that its not optimal for a certain % of humanity seems extremely high"
Deleted Account,23:15,"What do you think about all raw animal products? Fish, eggs, ruminants, organs etc"
Yan,23:15,i would argue the same thing about animal based diet. There is no one fits all
Deleted Account,23:16,"I mean, there’s a reason the bioavailability of nutrients from animal foods is so much better, no?"
Yan,23:27,thats exactly what my vegan friend told me too lol
Unknown,23:28,regarding the “read the science yan” part
Unknown,23:28,"i obviously believe veganism isnt the way to go for myself at all, just saying everyone seems to have science on their team"
Unknown,23:30,vegans claim u should accept their science
Deleted Account,23:30,"Thing is, the carnivore group on here is actually very into high quality, organs, etc. There’s other groups where people eat basically nothing but fully cooked, grain-fed hormone antibiotic meat"
Yan,23:30,"u say they wrong , they say u wrong"
Unknown,23:30,everyone has studies to show that back their claims
Deleted Account,23:32,Didn’t most indigenous groups typically average 70% of calories from animal sources?
Unknown,23:34,It’s really just common sense to me. Go out deep in the wild and tell me how much you can sustain yourself on nothing but plants.
Unknown,23:35,"People are also nomadic, you can’t just move to a new place and start eating all the plants you don’t recognize"
Unknown,23:38,"Also domestication and breeding of fruits and vegetables, gives people an unrealistic sense of what veganism would look like in the wild"
Unknown,23:39,I don’t put all my eggs into the “scientific studies” basket. I enjoy reading them and picking them apart. But for me it’s more of a common sense thing than anything
Unknown,23:39,Oh yea and winter 😅
Antón Leitón,23:47,I think I would prefer pasteurized butter than avocado

Unknown,00:25,na majority of my caloried come from animal based food
Unknown,00:26,just like playing devils advocate cos i think the whole thing is likely not as clear as night and day as its being portrayed
Deleted Account,00:28,That can apply to almost anything though
Yan,00:35,"depends on the topic but yea, when it comes to humans and health u could probably apply it almost anywhere cos its such an extremely complex field"
Unknown,00:35,and we are far from having solved it
Unknown,00:37,think the smartest thing to do is go with what feels best for you individually and always keep an open mind to admit u were wrong about sth and adjust them down the road
Unknown,00:37,"probably the reason why so many vegans are getting rekt, they been doing it since so long, would be too big of an ego blow to admit they been wrong the whole time"
Deleted Account,00:38,I think people in here generally have an open mind
Yan,00:38,that its not the holy grail
Deleted Account,05:11,It is difficult to trust anybody saying I'm strict vegan/carnivore/primal because you can't spend all day with them observing exactly what they are eatingYou can tell crowd that you are a vegan but eat meat when no one sees you.
Unknown,05:14,Especially I most suspicious about celebrities/stars/sportsman claimsThey obviously making money on every simple word spoken in public
Unknown,05:19,"This genius man said that mainstream medicine makes you fibre-dependent in inestinal health after killing your bacteria with meds and lifestyle😏Sounds mind blowing, going to test and researchThx for sharing"

I asked her how could I bring back acidic stomach pH after losing it during GERD medication.She was stunned 😁 with this question and asked ""why would I do that"".Indeed it is strange desire of person to restore normal physiology of his person, isn't it?"
Antón Leitón,08:46,I think that animal based is more nutritive. I prefer Enzyma and bacteria from animal that from a fruit
