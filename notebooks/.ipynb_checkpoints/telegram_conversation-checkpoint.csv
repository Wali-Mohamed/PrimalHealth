Deleted Account,09:02,you can go through 36h of fast depleting glycogen stores. And technicaly only after this pont fasting starts.
Deleted Account,09:38,"for me its a tool to rest the digestive system, going through candida die-off and its over 70 toxins beeing released is a lot of work for the liver, kidneys and gut"

Unknown,15:48,"4,5 h passed I feel neutral, zero hunger and body warmed itself to confort temperature. Before meal I felt colder than normal."
Unknown,15:49,Thx Ring
Silmavi,15:53,So when you have enough fat you feel nausea if you eat it?
Deleted Account,15:57,"So guys, water=bad?"
Silmavi,15:59,I have dry skin even if i drink twice lubrication formula

Unknown,12:59,I am mad at me because i got things in the wrong order.i Should have started with raw meat instead of raw veggies and i would have saved lots of health and time. When i was with veggies the world was pro meat and now i am pro meat and the world is pro veggies and grains.

Deleted Account,23:32,Didn‚Äôt most indigenous groups typically average 70% of calories from animal sources?

Unknown,00:35,and we are far from having solved it
Unknown,00:37,think the smartest thing to do is go with what feels best for you individually and always keep an open mind to admit u were wrong about sth and adjust them down the road
Unknown,00:37,"probably the reason why so many vegans are getting rekt, they been doing it since so long, would be too big of an ego blow to admit they been wrong the whole time"

Yan,00:38,that its not the holy grail
Deleted Account,05:11,It is difficult to trust anybody saying I'm strict vegan/carnivore/primal because you can't spend all day with them observing exactly what they are eatingYou can tell crowd that you are a vegan but eat meat when no one sees you.
